cleaned_content
has great features and i really enjoy the user experience however im continually running into technical issues like the timeline just randomly not loading not due to network problems on my end other apps and websites work just fine its a shame because i want to love this app but its just too buggy hopefully the developers will release some stability updates soon until then i sadly can only give it stars
this app has gotten worse and worse the longer i have used it its incredibly buggy the timeline refreshes randomly it can take a long time to load anything pages dont display anything sometimes the search function doesnt display results sometimes posts randomly disappear from the timeline the block function doesnt bar others from seeing your posts lots of bots and bot posts lots of hate speech that receives no moderation threats of violence are common and also see no moderation
with the introduction of four different levels of upgrades they have added them quite nicely to the top of each screen so that you know you always have the option to upgrade but something as simple as logging out of ones account you need to google to figure out on an android how to get to the option it should not be difficult as a programmer i learned in that the user interface is the most important aspect it defines the success of your application dont hide things
the app was great for connecting networking and getting updates from creators i was a fan of was now however it refuses to load any images pages videos or messages half the day its been chalk full of bots bugs and corrupt and sadistic people that have been platformed protected and amplified since it changed hands but hey it was atleast usable before i only give it stars because i still have connections there and hope it can come back in some way
one the app is increasingly full of disturbing content i just saw the creepiest bit of some music to the sexualization of children i rarely go on here and just downloaded the app and this is the horrible stuff i get its full of mostly misleading lying and polarizing content on top of this the app barely functions its got ta video controls on top of video controls keeps on bouncing around whenever you try to change one thing shocking at how bad the video controls are i could go on
great content and has been the media to follow after elon musk acquired it but it has several issues of the time it doesnt load videos and live just show a blank screen images take ages to load the ads are ridiculous its mostly adult games with mid graphics so annoying i tried i dont like this ad to manipulate the algorithm for months but no luck i really want to support the platform and want to contribute to political conversations but needs miracles to be able to use it
update i would give this app and the company zero stars if i could i received an email saying the email on my x account had been changed and if i didnt request it follow a link that link sent me on a circular chase that involves sending emails to the email i didnt add to the account effectively locking me out of my account not sure what happened but the app has been extremely unstable for about a month i have to go through my phones browser to use twitter with any consistency
i like using this app but there are a few bugs that can make it annoying i cant browse x when my phone is plugged in and also there are certain ads that lag my screen when scrolling i dont mind ads but if i dont like a certain one there are explicit ads i prefer to block them otherwise i love x and the way it helps me keep up to date with current events
i had x premium for a bit and it felt like as soon as i got it the app stopped functioning properly every post i tried to make would fail to send and my timeline would load a lot slower than before additionally the app is overrun by ads and bots walltowall toxicity and engagement farming has left the app a shell of its former self
old time twitter user the mobile app especially has become unstable it can crash constantly and many of its signature features have been removed there is a heavy amount of bots in every thread and because of the blue checkmarks getting priority every thread is really hard to interact with as you have to scroll a lot to see actual humans beings speaking the algorithm doesnt really adjust to your preferences it will give you things to get mad at in order to farm clics do not recommend
overally dont have any complaints as networking app it has enjoyable interface good algorithm of suggestions etc but the ad completely different story im not talking about the amount of it its barely any in here but what it shows that the problem for instance the last i got was completely irrelevant some russian ad of casino i think and its constant know that thats casino cuz i remember translating that a while back whatd be nice if ads were relevant at least by language
even ignoring the hostile algorithm increasingly hostile user base overt political lean of the owner and flood of bots and ads the app itself has only seemed to get worse over time function wise new features are buggy and unwanted or detrimental to the user experience user convenience and moderation has seemingly all but disappeared replies and videos often fail to load the following page often bugs compressing posts into glitchy lines of text i cant recommend in any capacity
update the glitches and crashes continue to increase twitter has been steadily declining since the change in ownership multiple times day it just wont load anything new force closing does nothing it always resolves itself but it takes minutes each time combine all the technical issues with the bots and lack of moderation and its clear twitter is dying the upcoming changes to the block feature may be the death knell of what used to be a flawed but incredibly useful app
this app has gotten worse and worse over the last year or more ive been a user for years and never had problems with the android app but now it fails to load content in a timely fashion regularly freezes or hangs multiple times a day and is generally becoming unusable its like theyre purposefully making it worse with every update its wild as compared to my ipad app that works exactly like it used to
great app if you like ads in a row one post from someone you dont follow and then another ads sometimes wont load at all notifications get super buggy sometimes when youre trying to make a post itll just stop working real quality not to mention all the bogus updates that keep rolling out to improve experience not sure whose experience its making better but it sure isnt most users
ever since an update a little over a week ago dms no longer work they freeze then you have to force close the app but dont think force closing the app is gon na help or anything because it doesnt pictures and videos sometimes dont load at all in the feed theyre just a grey box thats to say nothing about all the bots and what not even if the content were great though the app would still suck its almost unusable at this point
i almost never leave reviews let alone bad reviews on things however like many other people the recent updates have made the app extremely frustrating to work with sending messages is a pain with the app often crashing or flat out refusing to send in other cases the app just freezes similar to a deer in headlights this needs to be fixed people use these features and when you render them unusable you drive users away from your platform fix it
ads are now embedded in the home page so you cant block ad accounts that bother you and if they have videos with sound they will autoplay with sound regardless of your settings maybe try making your premium service worth buying by adding features to it rather than making the free version unusable without it also the app now wont work while charging your phone seriously try using the app right after you plug in your phone and it just wont work
i would advise you to look at the new privacy policy or even easier to go to settings then apps under x then top right corner see all permissions allowed most interesting is the one toread sync settings and very next one is ability to toggle sync on and off meaning if you werent syncing anything that they can sync it anyway with all permissions they could upload videos pictures and sync to all social media you have and turn sync back off like you did it can record audiovideosync it
basically unusable at times on a whim this app simply decides to stall out and not load a single thing video playing is also terribly glitchy ranging from freezing and skipping to not playing anything at all and displaying a black screen to audio inexplicably starting up from a video not even on screen just horribly optimized and has only gone downhill since it has become known as x
every update makes this app worse and worse half the time it does not even work stuck in an endless loop of error messages and crashes now they are changing the block feature to still allow people you have blocked to view your profile even if they can not interact with it completely defeating the purpose of the feature it is fostering an incredibly hostile environment and running it into the ground
app has been ruined by bots and my feed being filled with content i have no interest in so i have to keep blocking people to get rid of it now theres an issue where images wont load for me until i restart the app multiple times didnt have any problems until it changed ownership update as of app is even more unstable loads nothing of the time just awful
app has significantly fallen off in the last year huge increase in aibot accounts timeline wont load unable to retrieve messages most times playback errors and the lack of the ability to disable video autoadvance on android the content is still decent but dont understand how you can take a good app procced to make it harder to enjoy i would like to use the app more than i do but often just close it out of frustration
the app will randomly stop working and just fail to load for hours on end the browser version works fine when this happens but without the same functionality i like the platform but the app is terrible because of this its like its just stuck with no internet no amount of restarting the app can fix it either i even restarted the device and it still wont work
hopping on board with everyone else as the app continues to updates regular features are rendered unusable after many attempts to just kind of deal with the app keeps repeatedly closing down every time i try to send messages so im only able to use the desktop version in my browser its frustrating to see how fast the decline is
keeps getting worse using a mobile web browser is actually better than the app the only thing the app does better is load videos sending posts with media in them fails to send at least half the time in the app everything works better in a web browser the app also refuses to load occasionally so i just have to come back later to use the app your posts now are going to be used to train ai and the block now barely does anything this social media is terrible now
i used to really like this app but now i get constant crashes and freezes especially when i go to send a dm to a friend as youre about to send the message ot just freezes and crashes the whole app thus making you have to start it up again at least times until it finally starts working again just for the same problem to happen repeatedly please fix this
images and videos dont load unless theyre ads at least of every posts youll see is an ad unless you pay for the app voice notes dont load dms crash all the time they eliminated search in dms and bookmarks ages ago so bookmarks are basically useless the app is basically useless only reason it gets stars is because im trying to reward the three people im assuming that are allowed to try and maintain the android version of the app its not their fault their job is impossible
they finally added the option to disable auto advance for android amazing definitely not a change that shouldnt have been necessary in the first place the rest of the app still sucks though too many ads most of which constantly cause refreshes a ton of lag or the inability to watch a video not full screen very obviously biased towards right wing politics despite what elon liked to claim when he bought it
i have used this app for over years it has gotten less reliable as far as function every day at least post fails to send im also finding that premium is not overly beneficial for most users which i am sure they figure out quickly so many of the responses are recycled memes for engagement farming i feel the app changes have only benefited a small number of users its still fun to scroll its just not as good as it was grok is fantastic and really the only reason i have premium
it keeps crashing on me works fine for a few minutes and then crashes it wont send my tweets and half the time notifications wont work recently i cant use my notifications to get to a conversation on some of my accounts edit the app continually freezes and crashes not responding to what i want to do it has just gotten worse and now i cant respond to half of my messages in the app without the app freezing and my phone telling me to put the app in a deep sleep
nothing has changed still unloadable garbage posts buffer video buffers report function is useless block function is useless feed is full of just ads and bots if you can even load them forget about saving your place when you scroll on a feed that over refreshes terrible updates not to mention search function is bugged replies posts and images on your home page is mashed up and bugged if there is a terrible idea it is either implemented or will be implemented
this app as well as the website on pc is so unbearably slow that it has frozen my phone and dragged my pcs speed to an absolute crawl just by being open ive done everything from clearing the cache on phone and pc to uninstalling reinstalling or shutting off my pc to fix the issue and nothing fixes the issue but the fact that its happening to multiple people everywhere on multiple devices already shows the issue is not on my end
nothing loads theres a good chance when i open this app that nothing will load posts photos videos dms etc this has been an ongoing issue for most of this year ive done the usual troubleshooting clear cache clear data reinstall nothing solves this issue its getting to the point where im just going to use a web browser
what a joke of an app this is havent used it in months somehow it set up its own fa which i can not access trying to reset the password doesnt work either doesnt really matter in the end since i was only trying to log in so i could permanently delete my account i guess now my account will just be hacked and used by some disinformation bot garbage app garbage company
service is unusable anything related to seeingsharing media is buggy videos dont load or delay to loaddont run or run at like x playback speed skip and freeze when someone likes a post you see the notification like times underneath the post they liked its truly a bad experience i wish i could give this app an even lower score its been consistently bad and worse than the ios app feels like nonpremium accounts are being throttled app is so unstable
this app was better as twitter as soon as it was called x everthing went downhill too many crashes and too many times it freezes also there are too many ai bots and so much propaganda on there its not fun anymore i cant even make a whatever its called now cuz i could be in the middle of one and randomly closes this needs to be completely shut down forever or revert back to its glory days where it was a fun place to meet people
at least once a day the app gets bricked for an hour cant loadrefresh anything the ads have been super weird and appear more often lately as well everything is targeted according to whatever the topic of the main post is and the regular feed ads look like nothing more than obscure popupsdisplay ads thatll give you a virus if you click them also the amount of botsof spam that pollutes posts is crazy now most comments are filled with them
this app used to be good and working decently now its just full of glitches and pretty much unusable at this point im constantly get kicked from my account due to an error things dont load properly when im on wifi or mobile data im constantly having to verify and unlock my account at least once or twice a week for suspicious activity when i havent even been on
the app has a lot of bug to start the privacy settings not working to how they are configured half of the time search doesnt work and lastly on my android it uses an insane amount of battery so much that even when the phone is plugged in with the app open my phone will not charge other than that its decent media content and mutuals
laggy and terrible on android after updates this app used to be fine in the last to months it doesnt work like every other app when transitioning from wifi to g and vice versa in the last update its now slow and laggy crashes all the time and is a horrendous experience i had hopes elon would reduce censoring and improve the app but sadly hes only doing one of those things edit new update installed expected maybe this junk app would be fixed turns out no
my phone was regularly getting system ui has stopped responding errors until i deleted this app even when not using the app my phone has been running faster and hasnt been erroring since deleting it which is nice but not as nice as the boost my mental health has taken in getting away from that absolute toilet of a site steer clear unless youre very right wing and willing to pay to be heard
this app is horrible i cant even open it up anymore it wont load connected to wifi every other app on my phone works fine but it will just continue to load or randomly kick me off when the app is actually working this is me editing months later it has not gotten better if anything only worse cant open the app randomly nothing will ever load so infuriating trying to find something that i was just looking at and now its gone forever
ive got the highest update for android and x app crashes constantly and its been ever since the latest update i used to love this app but now im looking for a new one that wont crash every seconds ive used the app for years and never had any problems but with the latest update it sucks my device is updated but the app sucks doesnt send half the messages or shuts down while typing poor quality of the app
this app is broken beyond belief its genuinely incredible i cant use it at all if my phone is charging everything will just load forever until i unplug my phone and restart the app i dont understand how you can mess up your app that badly other than firing all your previous staff who kept the thing running this place is a dumpster fire under musk and it shows no signs of improvement also let me block people for real
every single day it acts up i either cant get my feed or i cant get my homepage when i go to the site through chrome it works fine so its definitely your app i still have lte and wonder if thats why it performs so poorly its fine in my g device while its not working on this device which is my primary device because i have unlimited data please fix ive updated and cleared the cache numerous times doesnt help
this app has been bad but its gotten even worse lately the thing cant work without crashing at least once every five minutes which has interrupted voice messages multiple times now hey muskrat i dont like repeating myself do something productive for once instead of being an egocentric weirdo update even after uninstalling and reinstalling this app continues to crash and wipe paragraphs ive written from my dms leading me to write elsewhere and then copy and paste
almost every time i tap the icon the app takes me to the login and even after using the correct info reloads to the login i have to close the app and reopen it and then it takes me to my page need to stop implementing stupid ideas and fix stability and getting rid of the spam accounts since the ownership change app has become absolutely horrible
ever since the current owner bought this app its been downhill ever since things dont work opening the app lags at times a huge problem with bot accounts and completely functional features get replaced or removed entirely so many people have moved away from this app due to this and it wont be long for it to all crash and burn
this app crashes multiple times a day but only in the direct messages sending a message can take up to secs if it doesnt crash meanwhile iphone users arent having issues literally makes no sense to have an app not to work for android i dont want to use my mobile browser just to send dms fix this
premium is a scam they never give the features i bought premium for the background video playback feature it doesnt work i contacted support they asked for a screenshotrecording of the issue you cant record or screenshot background video playback lol i didnt receive a reply contacted them again asking for a refund since they cant give me the features i paid for they said no so i reported the charge as fraud
horrible experience it doesnt matter if im on fast wifi or on cellular the images never happen to load in a quick amount of time the only solutions that i have to rely on are switching off and on wifi or force closing the app which are just temporary solutions and dont offer a full working method to stop this from happening
very bad and getting worse ever since youknowwho bought this thing its gone bad and continues to get worse ads after every third post certain content being promoted to hell and back and a paid subscription whos going to pay for twitter on top of that blocking is nearly useless now accounts you block can still view your profileposts just not interact with them this enables predatorscreeps to continue doing what they do best terrible all in all cant wait for it to die
can work okay for stretches but at least once a day the app just stops working and i cant refresh my feed or load anything for min hour makes the app difficult to use for following live events my main use of the app cant turn off auto scroll on videos audio from the for you tab continues to play in the following tab and vice versa
twitter has degraded so hard the last few months its virtually unusable at many points edit this is still the case but its more unusable than usable at most points i dont think they ever planned to fix any of the bugs within twitter because its just rapidly degrading more most of the time my feed does not load anymore if it does i need to load it with data wifi does not work for this app not sure how its still running
honestly its soooo buggy some days that it makes it not even worth it to use the app notoriously when you load the app you get the spinning white wheel that seemingly never disappears while no pages refresh no videos or pictures load and no amount of closing out the app and clearing out ones cache fixes the issue other apps load so its not an internet or user error
doesnt even work when my phone is plugged inchargingit stops loading any new tweets wont show images videos or even replies you cant even dm support if you have an issue unless youre a paid premium member elon trashed this app they keep adding new features that degrade the user experience and it gets less and less functional with each new feature overrun with nazis and bigots trash app
horrible policy changes among changes to fundamentals that are incredibly unsafe are making the app pretty much entirely worthless you want to post art you made without it being used to train ai good luck you want to block someone in a way that matters ha at least it can show me the same nasty and inappropriate ads every posts it sure is good for that
the sports game pages are completely broken the little thumbnail scoreboxes that you can scroll left and right never load its just a row of empty squares if you tap one the blank spaces where the teamscores should be it takes you to the game page but every game always says were on the lookout for the top commentary and latest sections it never loads any comments about the game even if the game is well underway
the new update removes your block list and puts everything you asked twitter to block and make sure you see it every other post fake accounts every other post fake apps every other post chinese ads every other post it hasnt been addressed the fake app ads are under every single post now no amount of reporting the fake ads as they are ever addresses the issue i think the only course to address this issue is to stop using the app altogether
this might just be an android issue but for multiple hours a day this app is unusable this is not a wifiservice issue your feed will not buffer reload allow you to post or like posts everyday like you seriously can not do anything with this app currently been trying for hours to look at anything and nothing happens updated everything and this has been an issue for months now if you dont have this app yet dont bother now stick with facebook or insta
nonstop ads keep popping up either completely broken or just empty boxes that take up my timeline now i cant even open the app without the entire thing kicking me out altogether no amount of cache clearing our reinstalling will fix it and updating does legitimately nothing posting in general is a painful process i cant even do off my phone anymore do better and fix your app please
its absolutely amazing i love it edit ive been using this for years and have witnessed it getting worse and worse but i didnt think theyd actually completely wipe the twitter branding but unfortunately they did its a very generic name and i dont see the benefit of it at all instead of fixing actual problems this app has they keep changing other things that dont need to be changed muskrat is a joke
rampant fake information from elon himself please stop with going live popups when i open the app this app flat out sucks every update gets worse video quality is awful most of the time searching has been broken for weeks now with no fix in site searching is still broken sometimes getting the timeline to refresh is an absolute chore just have to stare at a spinning blue circle for seconds plus
used to be a good app community notes is a good feature its just unfortunately overshadowed by the myriad of other problems with the app not even getting into the content from changing the block feature to nonoptional data harvesting for their grok the overall consideration for ux is terrible the algorithm pushes political content despite only engaging in art content nonexistent moderation bots are rampant paying boosts engagement
this app has become unusable in the recent months each update continues to have all the same problems with new ones the timeline refuses to load often videos do not load so i have to open the link in chrome to watch them like other reviews state there are often ads shown in a row also the automatic scroll on videos when they actually play that is untoggleable is insufferable i dont want to watch random videos i wanted to watch the one i clicked on
this app is actually usable it will refuse to load anything at random even after opening and closing it repeatedly i had thought it was an issue due to how old my version was so i updated it not only did the issue still persist but i now have constant overwhelming back to back ads spam my feed in literal rows that will lag the app this app is genuinely pointless to have because simply using it in a mobile bowser makes it run better it just a storage drainer if anything
i enjoy using x for everything its great to stay uptodate on current events favorite athletes debates unpopular conversations and to hear every side of the politicalideological spectrum it helps shape an overall understanding of those i agree and disagree with so i can better formulate my own ideas its very difficult to get that from other social media apps my favorite features are lists utilize them for realtime categories hope this is helpful
every so often the app will refuse to load my timeline profiles comments etc its as if i dont have any connection but i do all my other apps work and ive even tried changing from wifi to my data plan with no change closing the app and force stopping the app also has no effect this issue occurs randomly and takes up to an hour to fix itself its becoming more frequent and annoying also why is there a new update pushed every other day is x that unstable
the media player is just fully broken every few videos it stops being able to play any video or gif and just shows playback error im having a way better user experience in the browser rather than the app sad also the amount of ads is nuts ive gotten as much as or ads in a row as the ads load the page jumps all over the place too ill be trying to read a post and the ads make the post im reading disappear just use the browser if you want an actual useable experience
this app is damn near bricked it need a serious overhaul for its stability love the features that have been added like edits longer posts longer video uploads etc but whats the point if the app doesnt work fun fact ive noticed that the app is unable to load if im charging my phone without fail im actually impressed by the randomness of this bug
the app freezes very often ill be watching a video or reading a tweet and then ill randomly be unable to reply share or like the post itll last for hours sometimes ill even be sent notifs but when i try to open it the app wont show anything ill force close and even clear the cache and most of the time it wont do anything still if it does work the post will disappear and wont even be in the liked section of my profile also get rid of all the conservative political ads
this is a review of the app not the platform because i can access the platform through a browser as well the app has alerts that wont go away even when ive cleared them it also fails to alert me when ive marked accounts for notification frequently the lists function doesnt work least briefly and the timeline often just loses place and jumps around the end result is a poor experience through the app
the app is constantly crashing multiple times a day i try to get on and am met with a can not retrieve posts at this time message almost every single day at least once if not multiple times videos will randomly pause even when my wifi is fine the app just does not work of the time not to mention all of the weirdpredatory ads and influx of bots it is just not enjoyable to use anymore when the app is actually usable anyways
terrible nothing loads it randomly decided when it wants to start working everyday multiple times a day it decides it doesnt want to load anything update june still doesnt work of the time it seems like it only works in minute burst then it has to cool of for minutes before its ready still cant use it when charging my phone it takes forever to send a tweet i have been using the web app which works with no issues it would be nice if the actual app works though
this used to be my favorite social media app but lately its been terrible literally everything takes forever to load the timeline a post a profile theres a playback error for every other video theres also way too many ads oftentimes therell be ads in a row before i see one post and then its another few ads i made my acct back in and ive honestly been thinking about just deleting it ever since the change from twitter to x its been downhill
quality of the app has gone down if it aint broke dont fix it why does it take forever to load things sometimes i see ads or more in a row now before i see a tweet broken dm notifications whats changing on the backend with years of app use before i rarely ran into these types of problems settings layout is long and complicated now too hard to find certain settings
twitter x has been my main social media app for years but since its shift to x ive had a lot more bad experiences i am currently having an issue where the app just takes way too long to load anything cant refresh page and when it does refresh no pics or videos or any media is loaded just the posts videos take a while to load when clicked on i cant scroll down past the first posts without it having to take a long time to load more posts
this app has gone downhill for the past couple years but now it wont even open it crashes as soon as i try to open it and nothing fixes it ive tried clearing cache and data uninstalling and reinstalling waiting for days and no improvement to something staff claims is fixed never had problems when it was still twitter i can tell you that much
ads are egregious now predatory even i cant scroll two posts without being hit with backtoback advertisements instantly flooding the page videos will autoscroll a feature ive heavily disliked already and enter an indefinite and static ad disrupting the flow the autoscroll feature wouldve had on the right after the first video this is disgusting are you really scraping the bottom of the barrel for income at the expense of users experiences on your platform yes absolutely
the app performance is garbage when i watch videos i constantly receive the message playback error and a cursory search shows im hardly the only one the app wont load messages several times a day photos wont load when you click on them etc etc ive already uninstalled and reinstalled the app cleared storage cleared cache adjusted settings on my phone and more
i have been a twitter user for north of a decade nearly every update for the past two years has driven the app further and further into unusability lists glitch out and dont display recent tweets dm sessions often force the app to crash and reopen often in the middle of typing notifications are completely bugged and unusable and the sheer amount of spam scams and mismanagement is unmatched even older versions of the app are more stable than this garbage
this is a review of the app not the platform txitter on desktop works decently well most of the time but the app has become unusable its full of unblockable ads that autoplay video where before it allowed you to curate your own experience with ads the ads are now the only thing that load consistently well as the app breaks frequently now its just a really negative experience overall after using this since im going to delete it now because i do not see it getting better
everyday multiple times a day the app just stops working and wont load anything its very annoying sometimes it can be long periods of time before i can get new content closing the app clearing cache and unistalling then reinstalling do nothing to alleviate the issue it just starts working again this issue has been going on for a while with multiple users complaining cant understand why its not fixed yet
awful there are too many ads on my feed and tons of the unblockable ads feature graphic or violent content and theres no way to report them the subscription model is ludicrous i uninstalled after reading their announcement about making the block feature useless its completely unoptimized and takes an unforgivable amount of time to load this app needs to be delisted and removed from the google play store
ever since elongated muskrat took over the app just went downhill the report function doesnt work at all the load times are significantly slower image quality is horrendous notifications break a lot for messaging and messaging in general is really slow and awful i never had any of these issues before until elon took over update x is essentially removing the block button so ive uninstalled good riddance
the app has changed ever since its transfer of ownership im constantly receiving ads and odd political messaging blocking the ads or indicating that im not interested in seeing this kind of content has no perceived effect there are so many other concerns but as of now i have no desire to utilize a platform that openly incites hate and aims to spread misinformation
recent updates have made the app extremely sluggish and crash prone after using it for more than minutes and no its not my phone no other app on it has this problem at all update it still keeps happening and has since roughly june th or so but for about weeks prior to that it worked normally and sometimes its as little as minutes now and not just so yeah its not an issue on my end
i do not review many apps at all twitter used to be an app i mildly enjoyed using now its an app that is held together with tape and bandaids there are useless updates like the video autoscroll feature this feature is extremely bad and there is currently no way to turn it off its almost as if they dont know what their userbase wants at all dont worry sometimes you get a playback error and videosgifs wont play at all then you have the scammy predatory ads app is garbage now
twitters latest problem is playback error hire back some engineers pls also i scrolled past ads in a row and theyre almost all playing videos now even though i have video autoplay turned off thats my biggest grievance i dont want things to be moving and while im here the app takes forever to refresh first time in the morning just spins and spins until i close the app and try times
constant playback error messages when trying to view any videos on mobile app for android clear datacache doesnt help reinstalling doesnt help need to close and reopen the app at which point my feed refreshes and i have to manually search for the video and theres no guarantee i dont get the playback error all over again makes user experience pretty awful
over the past several months the app will randomly not load tweets media etc i have to wait hours before it starts to load again it does not matter what type of connection i am using i never had this issue when it was twitter app has gotten terrible update i saw another review that mentioned the app going slow when charging your phone this is true wow after all these months i finally see that charging your device causes this please fix this
the app randomly crashes and often says its having difficulties playing videos after scrolling for a few minutes wish theyd fix that bc i do appreciate a lot of the content being posted it also will choose to replay the audio of the first video i watched over a video swipes down so ill have double audio for no reason i also dont like the reply system depending on when you press it you cant see the other replies and can only reply blindly very odd glitches
ever since musk took over this app and everything related to twitter has gone downhill this app frequently stops working for no reason at all even when connected to wifi or on my data it takes several hours to correct itself and force closing and restarting does nothing it used to happen occasionally now it happens every day sometimes multiple times a day what a waste
i like the app for the most part my only issue is that im not entirely accustomed to how everything is layed out and functions things could be familiarized a bit more from both sides also a youtube and youtube music like function incorporated into different sections of the x app would be awesome youtube music especially im nearly always jamming work play relaxation so a setup like that would keep me in contact with what i like
i have run into more technical issuesbugs in the past months than i have in the previous years of using twitter videos are non functional often with skips video and audio distortion timeline just fails to load this still happens daily this coupled with removal of good features such as circles and paywalling verificationreply boosting a paywall that doesnt even remove ads mind you leaves this platform in a sad state of affairs will be searching for a new one to switch to
video playback error video playback error video playback error ads in a row video playback error ads load instantly but all other content takes longer and so many ads so many ads oh and the bots i never had issues with the amount of bots a couple of years back but recently theyve just been nonstop all over the place
things the app constantly reloads meaning you lose posts that you were interested in even your own page whenever i want to scroll on my page to see some old posts i cant even go days out before the page reloads for whatever reason the app has decided to do autoplay where while watching a video when done it starts playing another video i hate this i cant find anyway to turn it off in my settings
x automatically playing new video after video ends this is not acceptable any random video can come up and ive seen some pretty terrible things due to this upon searching forna fox it appears to be a problem everyone has going to pause my x usage until its fixed and notify advertisers when you see how many people take issue with it its time to revert back to how things were gone into the trash since elon purchased its like hes trolling users not worth the hassle
app keeps crashing freezing slowing down and eventually crashing my phone to the point it has to reboot itself burns up and drains the battery too freezing and crashing getting worse and the ads my god its absolutely insane the amount of ads very likely the cause of the crash freezing runs slow app wont close freezes crashes phone
x has become hyper aggressive with ads on mobile one to six ads after every rd or th tweet and so many times ive said that i dont want to see temu ads yet it only shows me temu ads ads before some videos ads in post replies ads in search area i select the option on the search menu that im not interested in a topic only for it to show me said topic again and again and again its almost like telling them you dont want to see certain content means literally nothing shocker
among a plethora of other issues whoever came up with the idea to make videos automatically advance to the next when finished needs to be fired and then have their head checked out the fact that this was pushed out with no option to disable is mindboggling this app has been going downhill for years but this is the last straw engaging with any kind of video content has become so incredibly infuriating and does nothing but serve as a reminder of how horribly run this whole platform is
this app aint quite the same as it once was videos wont load photos wont load at times and even the occasional playback error pops up when you try to watch a video on your tl dont get me started on the bot problem and ofc disabling likes i recommend finding another app or just uninstall this app because the apps not as functional as it is before
this is the glitchiest app i have on my phone ever since its gone under new management it acts up no exaggeration at least once a week this used to be my most used app but its become so unreliable that i dont use it nearly as often anymore the app just wont load or refresh will give you the spinning loading circle of doom timeline will randomly refresh when you open the app and scroll so you can say goodbye to that tweet you were reading its all a mess
last few months the app wont refresh sometimes for a whole day nothing works to resolve it even restarting my phone doesnt fix it also more and more posts with pictures or gifs arent being allowed even when the comments are nonexplicit been getting worse in the last few weeks more bugs than anything i think the people at twitterx are trying to make elon look bad by sabotaging the app
this app has been doing nothing but getting worse for the last year or two videos seem to frequently have trouble loading and i constantly have to close and restart the app recently they changed video playback to where it automatically starts playing some other random video as soon as the one youre watching ends instead of having it loop like before it makes trying to watch videos very frustrating i miss the old twitter
the new thing where when a video completes it auto swipes up and auto plays a new unrelated video is inaccessible to start with it doesnt respect the autoplay accessibility setting which feels awful as someone who needs that setting also auto scrolling up into the next video is awful as well because it takes me away from the content i intended to engage with and into something unrelated and scrolling back down is sometimes difficult please remove this feature or add a new setting
been dealing with a bug for a while where the same content on my x feed stays the same and it wont refresh or load anything new i try to open peoples accounts from the feed and they wont load either if i wait long enough eventually itll kick in but sometimes it takes forever ive tried restarting my phone in between freezes and that doesnt do anything either
auto scroll on vids got annoying immediately and on top of that a random video its autoscrolled past will keep playing audio in the background even after pausingclosing the video it will keep playing the audio and even on the phone home screen keeps playing but for some magical reason it wont play the audio when an ad rolls the second thing is that it feels like its trying to force me to buy the premium service with the amount of advertisements that are crammed down your throat
truly a user experience that has rapidly worsened its insane how often it freezes and refuses to refresh force quitting and restarting does nothing it randomly prevents liking posts autorefreshes the feed so i lose what i was going to likesaveshare ive had to instead memorize the username of the poster and google it and force the result to open in the mobile browser version of the app you have to use the mobile browser version instead of the app waste of space do better
overrun with ads trolls and misinformation the performance of the app and platform have taken a nose dive in the last years features and integrations break constantly with fixes taking forever theres been zero innovation or updates that have positively moved the product forward it is sad that this once mighty platform has been reduced to this this is what happens when you lay a ton of people off that were supporting the product and just use it for political gain
new features are bad when i try to use the app it blacks out every so often when i click on an image or video my phone is weirdly slower the app also sometimes glitches out full pixelated mess before it blacks out usually when i click on someones profile new block feature is bad im uninstalling because of the block mess unsafe unhappy goodbye my friends
while some folks have left i stuck around bc ive just been there so long and like getting news and happenings so quick i stopped visiting it so much months ago because it always would crash or i would have issues signing in i went back today to deactivate and so i took a quick stroll before i did its clear that x is trying to force people into paying for x to get away from all the ads that show up its also clear that x has filled it with bots and is toying with the algorithms
i have been a twitter user since it was the one social media app i have relied on for breaking news and current events but since it has gradually gotten worse and worse now all the ads are embedded in the home screen and can not be removed the app regularly stops loading media and reading replies in inundated with blue checked bots now the block feature has been removedis completely useless overall this platformapp is unusable unstable and a corpse of what it once was
b em bought it i had issues plethora of issues its worse off than b now its basically become a sponge for ads ads andor accounts that you can not block either its just a place for em to make himself more rich than hell ever need to be i have found a more likable place that can still deliver accurate and secure content just as well if not safer than x over at bluesky
im so annoyed with the audio from videos that continue to play in the background even after foreclosure clearing cache and stopping app what the hell then there the issue that several others have mentioned blank videos and annoying ads i will never pay a subscription fee for ad free anything any more
used to be the go to app for breaking news from the worlds top journalists over the past several years it has devolved into a cesspool of hate and disinformation im sure that in the new world order however it will again rise to become part of the propaganda tools used by us agencies and their lickspittle lackies to make all nations wish they could be as great as once were
huge potential but despite being the selfproclaimed home of free speech there is clear bias as soon as the feed is alright algorithmdriven the algorithm writers clearly control what is amplified and what is diminished update leading up to the election and in the days following this app has become increasingly openly hostile to any nonconforming views with the owners overt participation in the election all objectivity was lost deleting from all apps deactivating account
most of the updates nowadays have always been halfbaked unusable or made the user experience outright worse i get that its entirely necessary to monetize a platform to keep it afloat but incentives including both getting priority viewership and ad revenue shares has very easily intensified the whole bot problem theyve been celebrating having fixed it i use this platform solely for business networking at this point and if i had the option id get rid of it hands down
i use this app all the time on an android smartphone addicting however nowadays i feel like half the time this app abruptly stops working when freshly opened postsimagesvideos do not load new notifications arent displayed and new dms arent loaded and shown i try to mitigate this by force stopping in the apps settings and freshly opening the app but almost all the time this does not fix the issue this apps functionality is shoddy on android
not only is there catering and little punishment for awful people but the app has slowly degraded to barely functioning my notifications bug out constantly feed resets randomly feed quite often cant load images for insane amounts of time with fast internet mobile service tried report system displays as little information once a decision has been made so you cant follow up on it pngs with transparent backgrounds will often bug out and much more to come its like theyre features
this app has been rotting for a long time but recently it is completely unusable the content filtering is non existent you will see something vile and illegal no matter how much you try and stop it blocking no longer stops people from seeing your content everything is an ad image compression has worsened it does not run well i recommend getting a bluesky account
ever since the recent updates my x app has kept on freezing and crashing i always have to uninstall and install it again for a smoother experience and then the issue just resurfaces again its getting tiring having to reinstall over and over again having to log in all my accounts and set up settings when will this be fixed hasnt it been a months
frequent bugs bad app if you leave the app open enough it will start playing previous videos you watched at the same time as whatever you are trying to watch this seems to be linked to the auto play feature that forces a video to play when you first open it and that automatically moves to the next postvideo when your current video ends automatically which is a terrible feature and makes the app terrible tiktoklevel garbage additionally videos restart horrendous for long interviews
recently the app hardly works it keeps crashing all day long it will work for a minute then it will freeze and close i reopen it for it to then a minute later freeze and close its such a hassle to use the app now it takes forever to load anything if it doesnt crash it also the auto refresh sucks ive lost so many tweets because it refreshes for no reason
edit glitchy and sucky since got worse after musk and now its basically dead space and still glitchy ended up uninstalling twitter usually works well for me but after this recent update it has a glitch where itll close the app randomly while im using it its gotten so bad that i cant even use it anymore itll close the app within seconds of me opening it ive tried unandreinstalling logging out and back in turning my phone off and on and nothing has been working
update didnt think it could get worse but just switched graphic content to off now im getting gruesome post shown to me without even warning even the setting are broken turning off retweets doesnt do anything no filters for viewing many issues and lacking tons of features that other apps had but they have since destroyed out of greed
unusable ads glitch and crash it app crashes constantly ads pop themselves onto the screen fullscreen and wont let you close them the app has completely fallen apart and thats not even getting into how far the quality of the information checking itself has fallen never downloading again until its reowned by someone with actual brain cells
i gave xtwitter some leeway after the musk acquisition but the entire platform became so utterly vile after that as if it wasnt already antagonistic enough i gave it a year as an experiment and finally had to just walk away i can not separate the quality of the software with its ui content moderation or inescapable saturation of people who are rewarded for being angry all the time its time has come and gone
tried the app because i thought it would be more convenient than the browser version but i was wrong the timeline constantly updates in the middle of me reading posts or it will just make posts disappear from the timeline never to be seen again which is infuriating because i want to use x for live news and updates but i cant i also feel like theres way more ads thrown in my face in the app version as opposed to the browser version which which is also not great
twitternow x was once my goto platform for realtime updates connecting with others keeping up with the latest trends however ever since that attentionseeker guy took over and rebranded the platform things have gone downhill changes to the platform the relaxed moderation policies the push for paid features have made the experience much less enjoyable what used to be a simple effective tool has turned into something unrecognizable its disappointing to see how much it changed
cant deny that theres been a degradation in user experience over the past couple years i regularly have the app crash or return to phone home screen with a message saying a cache clear is required before restarting the app in terms of content on the app theres been a noticeable increase in bot behaviour comments sections are full of them i will miss what was once twitter
i had no issues wz x but nearly a month ago it went crazy i cant log in and i keep getting a message that there was a suspicious log in entry i tried every log out reinstall change password but nothing works except i have restart my phone every time i wan na use the app horrible also when i dont like an ad it just keeps popping up even if you scroll down you just keep taken back the ad again
this app continues to experience bugs every day all the time every time i type a message in dm the app suddenly stops forcibly for no reason or when im scrolling the timeline it suddenly freezes and cant be refreshed even though my internet connection is very stable unfortunately i was forced to uninstall and reinstall the app and sometimes it didnt work to solve this bug problem this application is getting more and more bugs day by day its very troublesome
since the last update it freezes constantly while loading and retweeting i have a brand new phone no cache or other issues just since the update its almost becoming an unusable app freezes my phone constantly wont close it also opens up google xwhich is got knows what just a totally amateur soo that acts like malware instead of something you want to use dont bother
its been getting worse and worse since it was bought now it is almost unusable videos rarely work the feed jumps and refreshes when you are reading a tweet and those are just some of the app issues the website in general is now overrun by spam and bots since the ridiculous blue ticks the for you tab is now the default and it couldnt be any less for you it used to be a great app but musk has completely ruined it
the app for way better before now it has became trash for eg when ever i say i dont like this post or an ad it keeps displaying the same thing again and again no matter how many time i say dont show this to me it has really became annoying for me even my search and other settings for sensitive media is turned on i still see sensitive media in my timeline whats the use of it really annoying how twitter was and the state it is being ridiculous absolute ridiculous
it has been days since i cant log in on my twitter app it keeps telling me something went wrong both app and website it wont even bring up the page to put in my username and password the moment i click log in it will keep loading until it says something went wrong and all these has nothing to do with internet connection please kindly fix your app
the latest version auto plays videos once the video im watching ends another one automatically starts the is a stupid feature that is not neededthere seems to be a way to turn it off on ios but not android edit a new update has been rolled out and i now have to see news articles whenever i go to the search screen i can not hideturn this feature off it is almost as if they are pushing us to bkuesky or whatever its called
borderline unusable opening a tweet shows ads that take up too much space they dont load properly for a few seconds and when they do your scroll position gets reset old twitter app was very good at saving your position in the timeline the only way to lose that was to either refresh manually or force close the app its not that way anymore the timeline refreshes on its own while youre reading something and lands you in the middle of somewhere and forces you to scroll up
terrible forced to pay for premium to use functions that used to he standard plus the app doesnt even work properly trying to update or edit your information is tedious and error prone and im over x i havent been able to edit my account info for a week now always spits out an error also can not validate my phone number the app is very buggy it really sucks switched to bluesky
the playback errors and videos glitching is really starting to bug me no intended and the features that made the app a unique platform are starting to become more and more worse to the point that theyre just there but useless it was better when it was still twitter edit theyre still there and the app keeps crashing if i dare scroll for more than two seconds if there was an option for zero stars id gladly give it
latest app update doesnt let me embed videos easily anymore i used to be able to get the video link when i longpress on the tweet and it copies the text and video link now it just selects the text edit to add now its letting people that ive blocked still be able to see my tweets it also keeps failing to launch on the first few tries
this is unusable i can not go a minute on this app without it crashing examples being swiping maybe on post or half a post until it appears to have a seizure it sticks on frame and another and flashes on both of the only allowimg me to close it this happens when im scrolling tapping a button viewing a profile basically anything it started out once in a while to constantly i reset this tablet i reinstalled the app yet nothing works please fix this i really enjoy usimg your app please
videos constantly crash and the feed always refreshes shortly after opening it so you end up missing a post that you wanted to engage with speaking of engaging x is overwhelmingly infested with engagement farming bots finding a genuine human in the for you tab is very rare dont waste your time on this poor excuse for a social network unless you want the dead internet experience use a better network like bluesky instead
this was a problem in the past that was fixed but now its occurring again when i stay on dms for a period of time the app crashes and kicks me out not only that but its very annoying having to scroll up to reach unread messages instead of the chatbox loading there like other social medias operate please add this feature scrolling for too long in groupchats waiting for masages to load to reach the top can also trigger the bug that closes the app please fix this issue asap
this app is damn near bricked it needs a serious overhaul for its stability love the features that have been added like edits longer posts longer video uploads etc but whats the point if the app doesnt work fun fact ive noticed that the app is unable to load if im charging my phone without fail im actually impressed by the randomness of this bug and sometimes when a video plays it pauses for no reason the community sucks so hard
it is ok but sometimes it there is a bit of lag and glitches for example it logs out and when you try to log in again with the right account it says unable to process request and it returns to the login page even when you have a account it still does it so you have to close it and open it again for it to actually work it is ridiculous and when you go into settings it says enable when you have the app installed please fix so ill leave it at stars for now as i had to knock off stars
a nightmare now nothing good about this app and updates just keep making it worse and worse some features are useless also incredibly buggy glitchy and the timeline often doesnt even load at all i even see spaces from people ive blocked the amount of unavoidable ads too this app is garbage
this software is terrible and full of issues for example ive tried installing the app multiple times after deleting it and ive even updated it recently however it has a lot of problems such as frequent advertisements and a large storage footprint additionally if i want to submit a post to more than one group it pauses and returns to the home screen the application shuts down entirely im not fond of these bugs please resolve this matter as soon as possible elon
the app basically refuses to load work tweet out stuff whenever i put my phone to charging still not solved after months instead theyve added ads that somehow causes you to scroll onto them and keeps scrolling you back to the app update a few months later this things stated above are still happening but now playback error is happening more and more often well done i hope this app turns back into the twitter i loved soon
i like twitter i refuse to call it x its where i go to get the real news or at least try to the app has become really buggy to the point that it is becoming frustrating to use i now seem to be forever opening closing it to try to get it to work there are far too many ads but most annoyingly constant playback errors on videos or they suddenly stop playing halfway through tweets can take ages to load and for some reason the app is totally unusable if im charging my android phone
for such a big app youd expect it to be well maintained and less laggy when you scroll through videos the sound from the first video you pressed on will be playing over the sound of all the videos youre scrolling and its not a once in a while thing its every single time i decide to use this feature also the timeline automatically refreshes out of nowhere which makes you lose any posts you were looking at not to mention the new horrible block update but thats for another review
not nice at all the app more than usual blackout meaning somehow it doesnt get connected to the internet every app on my phone would be working just fine but when i get to the app x it keeps loading without connecting and is very annoying this happens every day maybe twice or times a day the app will work fine then suddenly it will lose connection there is definitely something wrong with this and is very suspicious i suspect that the us government is manipulating this app
high definition photos take too long to load at times and high definition video doesnt play at all there is also a weird bug where the sound disappears when you watch a video full screen and like it edit they made it worse now while scrolling down the timeline the app auto snaps back up to an ad forcing you to see it even if you scroll past it absolutely awful there needs to be a zero star option on google play this is bordering on unusable
the app constantly crashes or becomes a black screen forcing me to restart it this happens when doing literally anything scrolling through the timeline tapping on a tweet to read it tapping on a photo to look at it etc etc i usually cant use the app for longer than seconds without this happening when it does work its constantly loading more tweets in the background which it then rips me away from what i was looking at to take me to an appalling user experience
using x is like walking into a tech nightmare the app crashes so often its like its allergic to functioning videos overlap making every sound like a bad horror soundtrack and the message section thats where hope goes to dieit crashes before you even send a text it feels like a digital meltdown where nothing works and everything is broken x has gone from being a social media platform to a disaster zone its beyond repairits in full meltdown mode
i am encountering two issues with the app automatic scrolling the app automatically scrolls making it difficult to use could you please advise how to turn off this feature display over app the display over other apps is very small and i am unable to adjust the size is there a way to fix this or make the display larger your assistance with these matters would be greatly appreciated
since last week i have been unable to post pictures from my gallery initially thought the problem was from my end but it isnt overall the app has been good so far excellent interface and the likes but please make necessary adjustments thank you this is two weeks from the time i last complained you guys arent even doing anything to fix this no response or whatever thats too bad
the only problem with this app is loading media content it literally takes like seconds to load only one photo at moderate internet speed for a video you have to rewind it for like minutes for it to load completely or else it will stick to the same position forever and it sucks kindly improve on the media download process otherwise this platform is cool and addictive
have been using twitterx for almost decade and this is the worst experience i ever had with this app most of the time app is unable to load pics play videos and gif even its fails to refresh page when asked to app seems to be buggy slow and broken despite last many updates there is absolutely no improvement this is definitely not expected and desirable
oh my god using the app has become a total nightmare you cant send messages without about twenty taps on the typing bar the worst part it kicks you out of the chat without warning or reason the worst thing about that it deletes everything you wrote its not a problem exclusive to me several of my friends have reported the same thing and im starting to get fed up seriously its impossible to use its always closing for no reason
there are way too many bots and sometimes the app just decides to load nothing for several minutes no matter how much you ask to stop recommending a certain type of content you end up seeing it anyway the community note system has good intentions but its execution is terrible everyone posts nonsense and ragebaiting content because since the ownership change the dumber you sound the more attention you get its a complete disaster oh and its basically turned into paytowin
recently trashy id be scrolling through my feed or be on a space or texting and the next thing i know im back to my home screen the app automatically shuts itself i have updated i have uninstalled and reinstalled i have cleared data but all to no avail because right now ive uninstalled it again to reinstall it as of yesterday i got no notification on my phone i thought it was my notification settings so i checked but turns out it wasnt x has a lot of bugs to fix
the changes that have been made are so against the user experience its turning into such an awful app edit aug twitter x continues to be filled with bugs so many times the feed wont even load so the app is unusable even with updates edit september realized that the app legit just wont work if youre charging your phone edit oct its impossible to find things youve liked because it just sorts it randomly the block function doesnt block anymore illegal
ive been using x for a long time and i love it but why do the videos in my x are not playing at all theyre freezing i dont think its the problem with my wifi as it is strong and fast enough when i checked it the other apps were fine though i even cleared all my cookies and cache restarted my phone and turned off my phone but nothing worked i also logged out all of my accounts uninstalled and reinstalled the apps but it is still not working
x formerly twitter is a dynamic platform that serves as a hub for realtime news entertainment and social interaction the layout is userfriendly making it easy to navigate through trends and engage with various communities the character limit encourages concise communication which can be refreshing in a world of lengthy posts the recent updates have improved the user experience with features like spaces for audio discussions and enhanced search functions however the platform still
i love using the x app but there are some issues that need to be fixed therefore i am giving it three stars that is you may occasionally have a decrease in impressions analytics which can be quite distressing additionally they claimed that every premium plus package included complete advertising yet i am unable to see it why
i love having random unrelated posts show up on my feed with no reason other than the fact that the originating account owners paid for an arbitrary tick great job keep up the good work youd have thought a literal decade of following clicking into science news comic artists and the like would have stabilised the algorithm somewhat but no im now giving you a random tweet by katy perry deal with it oh they added autoscrolling to an advert after your video ends cant disable it
hardcrashes a lot you have to reinstall the app when it goes into a crash loop the size of your dashboard has been reduced to of what it was last year and you hit the bottom in less than a minute now app also autorefreshes your timeline while you are in the middle of readingscrolling forever dooming a lot of posts to the shadow realm the block button thing theyre doing is against play store tos so itll probably be gone by next week
update blocking now only half blocking the app hangs while i wait for content to load there are large irritating ads that make the screen bounce around it refreshes randomly and you lose where you were in your feed im spending much less time on twitter because bsky offers the old experience there are so many ads porn bots crypto scams and genuine neonazis twitter x used to be fun but its a tedious struggle to cut through the garbage now and interact with normal human beings
cancelled x premium as the platform is still censoring not for the first time but something that wasnt hateful after being up for a day was flagged as being so i appealed they stood by the original decision seems like there is still a level of activism amongst the ranks at x ive also had issues that point towards deamplification as my impressions went off a cliff edge for several days to for these reasons theres just no reason for me to pay a subscription fee
ads filling up the entire screen ads auto scrolling after each video ads about completely unrelated things blue checks rage baiting likes gone block and muting functionality dysfunctional everything is just bad its bad bad bad i hate what this app has become only being able to see qr despite the post having hundreds these damn ads video functionality is horrible temu ads things taking a while to load temu ads opening the app to a tweet only for it to refresh
update the video autoadvance feature can now be switched off thank god for that a longstanding issue remains when scrolling through videospictures where you never completely get to the end of the feed before it defaults way back at the beginning also followingfollowers lists could be for example but by around the list ends
recently ive been experiencing issues with sending and receiving messages on the twitter app the app keeps crashing despite clearing the cache multiple times while my friends dont have this issue it continues to affect my experience i am using a samsung a and im unsure if the apps compatibility with my device might be causing the problem could you please look into this
edit oct it is not working again when i open dm thread and click on the compose message box there is a second delay and the app crashes or it works and i can type the message but the app crashes as soon as i click the send button in that moment send buttons changes to voice button and the app crashes in that very moment i use samsung galaxy a
where do i startdm freeze of no reason the app crashes out of nowhere and thats when the app is working because most of the time when i try to open the app twitter doesnt allow me to log in and i have to force stop the app and then i can log in this happens multiple times a day i miss when twitter was usable now its just trashy
been trying to make an account countless times previously its working but i am having such a fine networkthe app keeps on saying that please do not try again it makes me so happy there are not some certain news that can only be found on x otherwise i wouldnt have installed this app i didnt request to quickly do not resolve any issue
ok i find it annoying that i have clicked on i dont like these ad but yet they keep reappearing in my news feed way to often so that is not making it better also there are way to many ads smdh really not liking the new app iconi just dont like changes to things that i have been used to so disappointing i dont like that every day the app wont refresh for plus hrsinstead of each time i go on the app so i end up missing a lot plus updating app doesnt fix these issues pls fix thanks
time and time again they release an update for the mobile app and some basic feature breaks ive finally uninstalled after experiencing constant issues with ads on the site id see the same ad repeat in a row sometimes times with more ads in between the ratio of ads to tweets is like this app has made the user experience frustrating beyond belief edit latest issue the app doesnt even work while charging your phone ridiculously poor app
its getting worser and worser the app has become so buggy everywhere i go in the app there has to be a problem i cant add my phone number to my account videos keep loading despite my internet connection being good as a user my experience is very limited too i cant write long repliestweets i cant edit them neither and i cant download videos from the app itself there are issues with contacting the staff as well
cant scroll through posts while charging the phone and seems like im not the only one also when i change the content you see settings it doesnt do anything i still get the warning in every post even when its a normal post with nothing much disturbing or sensitive
where is the promote this post button it just suddenly disappeared yet i have been using it for my business tried with colleguessame problem and when you try to use the launch a campaign it just rolls back to same button with the message the term you entered did not bring up any results so frustrating what wrong
sometimes i face difficulty in logging into the app and it then shows that something is not right try your request again but i dont understand what exactly is wrong another problem is occurring while looking at one post it suddenly changes to another post the previous post is completely disappearing this incident is repeated again and again please fix the issue
videos just keep playing in the background when you change tabs and overlap with each other also filters are broken blacklisting topics and words keep showing up instead of adding new features they should fix what is already on the app its ridiculously to ask for me to subscribe when basic functionality is broken
whenever i type on the app to message anyone if i make a spelling mistake while typing and want to go backspace to recorrect the word the word i am trying to correct will then blend into the last word like this blendintolast and it becomes increasingly frustrating to type twitter is the only app that has this problem because as im typing my keyboard isnt melding the current word and previous word together thus making it a massive chore to type terrible app to message on
apparently elon can put together an electric car but not keep a simple app running properly twitterx is a buggy mess that tends to more or less work most of the time somehow recent update completely broke dms not only do messages lag but most of the time i cant even open the text field without the app completely locking up restarted phone reinstalled app nothing helps to add insult to injury the web page is clunky and with faults of its own frustrating experience altogether
the only thing keeping me from deleting this app is that its one of the rare sites that allow content aside from that x has nothing of value anymore the app is super slow and encountering bugs is common ads are literally everywhere most of these ads are scams or nsfw there are a lot more bots that there used to theres a lot of misinformation being spread there because of the verified acc feature theres a lot of harmful rhetoric and ragebait as wellyeah go use bluesky instead
was on thin ice with this horrible app but after the dismal decision to rate limit this app as well as twitter as a whole is just useless now not to mention the constant dogshit saving bug where you if you try to save multiple pictures at once your app just cant keep up and youd have to restart it multiple times for it to work absolutely horrendous
the app itself is good but theres this one annoying bug which i just cant do anything about to buy premium you need to have a phone number which is already a bit weird secondly i keep getting a error saying that something went wrong try again later i have tried different phone numbers on different devices multiple times and it gives some the same error every time very amazing app well done
overall positive experience the algorithm learns quickly and rarely recommends me posts i dont like i encountered very few crashes in my two years two issues one the search results under top is usually inaccurate and even when a tweet is clearly spelled out will fail to show the correct tweet sometimes traipsing the latest section works but other times it doesnt incredibly annoying two the quote tweets will sometimes randomly fail to load or prevent me from scrolling too far
the android version of twitter x is almost completely unusable it will struggle to refresh the feed on the same connection as my desktop yet my desktop version works fine my own tweet feed wont display half of what ive posted i cant update my profile picture on the app and have to do it on a computer half the time my posts wont send and when they do it takes atleast a minute for a text only post turns out firing of your staff isnt a good idea
the site is riddled with bots and is constantly putting the most racist nonsense on my timeline even if i wanted to put up with that the app itself hardly even works it will just refuse to load or open any post for no reason and just stay stuck from anywhere as short as minutes to as long as an hour this isnt to mention how videos no longer replay and instead a loud ad will be shoved in your face at the end this app isnt what it used to be avoid it
this app is completely regressing in almost every way possible unable to filter out content and trends on my news and trends pages getting repeated ads that ive previously flagged as do not like cant even use the app while charging my phone shoving unwanted ai in our faces and being sneaky about it collecting our data and now youre changing the block feature into whats realistically a mute feature endangering users to harassment stalking and privacy infringement do better or quit
theres many changes that just dont need to be changed whenever these changes went live it affected the usability of the app ive been having problems playing videos ever since they announced that they will be changing some terms renaming the app and changing the logo now they removed functions of the block button i will be deactivating my accounts that havent already been deactivated since the rebrand
this app barely functions are the developers not capable or something its just a social media app i cant emphasize enough how broken this app is when you actually try to use it instead of just browse as of right now i cant even open up the app to use it it just close immediately how do you mess up this bad im literally having to uninstall and reinstall the app to fix the issue elon fire whoevers working on the play store app they suck at developing
cant believe i waited this long to check this app out finally a place to hear and engage with the world freely a place to hear all sides regardless of mainstream a tool to add to ones arsenal that provides for a more informed decision making process but it is a tool you must still use your own common sense and question everything yes there is a lot of whacky post but with a simple swipe anything that offends can be skipped goodbye facebook
used to be a really useful app for news and socials now barely works crashes constantly news feed is non existent reporting problems and errors doesnt work as does reporting inappropriate content now they want to take away blocking which is an important safety feature the app is now unusable and a shadow of its former self
something isnt right try your request again later this is what im getting everytime i try to open x my device is well uptodate and has no problem with the internet connection previously i ignored when this issue occurred for it lasted usually for few hours or a day but now this problem seems to be eternal and i dont see anything done to fix it
this app bugging a lot these days and the constant changes of the ui on different platform is annoying addition a year later i think the app is getting worse it loads posts and pictures really slow and i keep getting error when searching different topics or wants to check posts from trending hastags cant load the trending hashtags on mobile too
this is unbelievable as the app started working again in brazil i reinstalled it again but i cant log in after clicking on the option to log in it stays on the loading screen for minutes and then an error message appears and goes back to the home screen i asked friends if they were having this problem but they said that the app was working normally with them ive tried to reinstall the app several times restart the phone and even turn it off but it didnt work please fix this
would rate higher if my feed would only play one video at a time when scrolling not multiple like it frequently does on my moto g stylus g phone i really hate it when or sometimes videos play at once and you cant tell which audio is which for the video that youre watching without clicking onto the video to isolate the audio for a single video
i love x in the past after i responded to posts i could see many people responded to my comments likes reposted my messages past or days dont know why notifications dont appear despite me posting many messages i followed the steps in notifications timeline but there is still no change so very disappointed hopefully x can help me to resolve this issue
incredibly slow lags freezes works roughly hrs day the end user should refresh the fy page not the app every time you open the app and you see a post that interests you the app automatically scrolls you back up to the top lastly on the for you page where is the option to select not interested in this for new stories that have been showing for days straight
lowering to star because the quality of this app has tanked hard in the past few weeks feed refuses to refresh unable to save photos incredibly long postingcommentingdming times and an abhorrently slow interface are just some of the few issues ive recently began to struggle with despite the community ive fostered for myself on here i dont see myself using this app anymore because of how laughably bad it runs dont bother with this anymore join instead of this cesspool
the worst app right now with a bunch of random issues unnecessary large sized ads which ruins everything randomly refreshes and takes you somewhere random in the timeline suggested posts on timeline make no sense the worst part doesnt work when the phone is charging i have no idea why or how
the worst app i have ever downloaded every update just makes it worse blocking doesnt exist which makes it against playstore tos verification turned into a paytowin system the way the for you page works is nauseating and the place is completely overrun with bots and altright racists the only reason i still have it is because every content creator i still want to follow hasnt migrated to other platforms yet brb downloading bluesky
super laggy and juddery the rare time it loads properly at least once or twice a day i open the app and it just has a blue spinning circle to show its loading but never actually loads i open up a video and it just crashes not sure why i bother with it any more its annoying more than anything and just gets worseharder to use
honestly pretty unusable the ads are so in your face with autoplay videos despite my data saver settings and the app will interrupt my browsing by scrolling back updown to centre the ad plus with the updates to the block option that renders the function useless and allowing of generative ai scraping im uninstalling
an annoying app behavior x has is that it shows a post for about seconds when initially launching the app then the feed updates and its impossible to find that post you just started reading unless you memorized the username before it disappeared either load on the feed you are updating to or let me manually refresh the feed
stability and usability steadily declining videos are auto playing without an option to opt out direct messages barely usable the app freezes and crashes when tapping the text input field i have to use a browser on android because the app is so broken no idea how its possible to mess up this feature this badly algo prioritizing posts with lots of interactions a lot which promotes interaction farming user stay for the content but the frame for it gets progressively worse
after every rd or th video watched no other video works and i have to completely close the app of the time the app wont even load when opened just opens on the last newsfeed i had and doesnt refresh completely put off this app and it very much promotes hate accounts and violence accounts dont get me started on the freedom of speech more like freedom of certain speech and too many ads in a row after like every tweets and the dont suggest from x account is useless
oh where do i even begin with x once upon a time it was twitter a functional if not slightly chaotic app now its a complete mess and i think they intentionally made it this slow just to drive us all insane trying to scroll through my feed feels like im wading through molasses you open the app and it just hangs there half the time frozen like its forgotten what its supposed to do sometimes it takes so long to respond i wonder if my phone is broken but nope its just x being x
the app has been giving me headache for days this could be the second month having this problem it always lose connection like i can only use it for minutes then it stops working like for to hours i tried to update it but still no solution i dont even enjoy using it anymore and its the only social media i have
i sometimes accidentally tapped the notification without turning on wifi data or having slow connection then can not retrieve posts at this time please try again later you should have a retry button on the app when the user having this problem to avoid unable to see what post that it didnt load force them to go through the users page for that specific post if you see the notification worse if you accidentally tapped it without seeing the notification
this app used to be fun and i loved interacting with art communities but the update to change the block feature that allows those youve blocked to still see your posts is an absolutely terrible idea and is a breach of privacy and safety and i do not feel comfortable using this app also the planned change for november th to not allow users to opt out of data and image training for its ai is incredibly upsetting please allow users to be able to still opt out of grok and ai training
been trying to make an account countless times previously but even after having such a fine network the app keeps on saying that please try again it makes me so frustrated there are some certain news that can only be found on x otherwise i wouldnt have bothered with this app i request to quickly resolve this issue
platform itself is great to use and has many great features but the app does not even open for me most of the time lately one time this week it actually loaded every other attempt it freezes and wont respond at the logo loading screen the website is much better to use than the app
the someone posted button is very irritating there is no need for this if a user wants he can refresh like fb and other platforms if you have to show it then just show if the the accounts being followed by user posts something now but that also should not be in the middle of screen
crashing constantly and occasionally causing whole phone to freeze when its not crashing its causing other apps particularly spotify to crash its at the point where i have to clear the cache and reopen the app several times in one sitting absolutely impossible to use
x seems to be not working too well on android for a while now strangely enough when i open it it just does not want to refresh the timeline and this occurs quite regularly it keeps on loading for a very long time this is never an issue opening x on my iphone i have also encountered many times the videos that say playback error please fix this ranting update why is this app on android not being fixed despite the countless complaintsnegative reviews being posted
ive officially left the platform and joined threads the algorithm has become very pushy of certain types of content and is clearly muting others i dont want to be part of an app that has this take on free speech i just hope as the progressive audience tires of this that the app doesnt become a big group think tank and cause some real damage
the android version of the app has worked at functionality since the takeover tweets regularly dont load the search function crashes repeatedly videos dont play and thats not even to mention the way the user experience was plummeted with the plethora of blue tick trolls being boosted to the forefront of every single tweet hot garbage
the trusted digital town square for talking has obviously changed significantly with new ownership but when the dude running it is found to be the biggest spreader of misinformation on the internet and he changes the algorithm for me to see his posts when i never asked to it feels like he is being forced in my face its an invasion of me and my space its just another google facebook spy that tries to choose what information i access im out hello bluesky
recently back from a short hiatus the glitch that chases me away is still there to welcome me back the app is recently to say the least very frustrating it kept logging me out making me take some wild arkose verification if less than a star rating is possible id have done so its high time i left the app i think
im in nigeria and use a s the x app has been disastrous since the transition from twitter everyday there are times the app crashes and doesnt load till hours later this happens in every morning and during the day it is even happening right now it has been disastrous as this as happened for almost a year still no fixes this is not a network issue as other apps work for me just fine during those periods
the app has gone straight to hell since musk took over it continuously crashes or has technical issues telling me can not retrieve messages at this time please try again later and wont allow me to see any messages or post sometimes up to hours at a time its ridiculous i pay for basic tier for networking and outreach for new viewers to my podcast and its getting harder to justify keeping that
used the app for years or so updates ago the app started freezing and crashing refreshing the feed closing posts you just opened and further refreshing so youd lose the post and now on the most recent update no changes at all unusable right now phones not slow either on high end games etc just x
theres an audio glitch that causes the previous videos sound to play in the background until i completely close the app it happens multiple times a day when this is finally fixed i will change my review back to stars because aside from that its a great app update it keeps getting worse
wasting their time removing useful features like the block function despite the fact that a lot of things just dont work both the app and the site are so buggy its been months and i still havent been able to change my profile picture or header on the app reply sections are just filled with verified bots as well not a fun app to be on anymore
cant verify phone number no support ive been unable to verify my phone number on x for over a month blocking access to premium features ive tried every troubleshooting step contacted support through social media and explored all help optionsno response theres no clear way to report this issue directly as a paying user this is unacceptable please address this or provide a direct way to resolve account issues
update after the last issue got resolved the app has another serious problem despite my connectivity being strong videos keep glitching and they do not play smoothly i dont have this issue with tiktok instagram or any other apps but watching videos on twitter can take doubt the time because they randomly pausebuffer there is always another issue with this app regardless of how many times i restart the app or my phone to fix it rubbish app
ever since musk took over hes done several illegal things the latest thing is that hes effectively gotten rid of the block feature we no longer have the ability to properly block people the people we block can still see our accounts which can be extremely unsafe and abusive this app has become absolutely untenablely bad ive moved to bluesky as of today
no longer a real blocking feature timeline covered in ads after what feels like every post and certain words will get you all but hidden by the algorithm this app used to be fun and i used to rate it stars but with features and connections to other gamesconsoles ripped out since its hardly recognizable
ever since bozo bought it the lag is actually getting god awful every swipe youre able to very clearly see the app struggle to catch up with you maybe its the ads in a row swipes that have been installed onto your feed not only this but in terms of the artist community much of the platform has been taken over by talentless ai operators who are very much promoted by mr free speech through his hypocritical blue checkmark save yourself choose a different app
always crashing sometimes cant load photos or videos and it has nothing to do with internet speed in the middle of sending dms the app crashes and you have to start over cant send dm to more than people at once video automatically scrolls after watching poor safety measures for anyone and most especially minors app is full of nsfw bots and even people algorithm seems to work in favor of harmful rhetorics being most visible i would give less than star if possible
the changes being made have destroyed the app and made it rather unsafe things like the new blocking policy which makes it so that its essentially useless can and im certain will result in real life harm to people the app is no longer fun and any use one might derive from it does not feel worth it for how tedious its become riddled with ai slop bots and rampant misinformation i feel better off just using facebook
this app has fallen down greatly ever since it has been brought by a certain person in moderation is incredibly poor and is not friendly at all towards artists its still filled with bots a problem stated that would be fixed all solutions just made it worse and now the block button does not prevent the person from viewing profiles of who they are blocked from overrall this app has not been the name since the buyout left in an incredibly toxic state
every so often the app will refuse to load my timeline i profiles comments etc its as if dont have any connection but do all my other apps work and ive even tried changing from wifi to my data plan with no change closing the app and force stopping the app also has no effect this issue occurs randomly and takes up to an hour to fix itself its becoming more frequent and annoying also r why is there a new update pushed every other day is x that unstable
please fix playback errornot loading and image loading errornot loading its getting worse and worse not just on this app on web browser too too much ads backtoback ads post together instead of one ad post ads shown each time when scrolling down one video auto scroll down when video ends endless bots rampant etc so many bugs and glitches and unwanted features
this app has issues slows down the entire device on all my devices which is usually a good reason for suspicion also this app keeps blacking out especially in the message section sometimes the live spaces as well and those live spaces sometimes crashrug warning this app seems to still have some of the old backdoor to its system open from before elon musk bought it and i get the impression that the shills and snakes are still operating through those old backdoors
ive been having an issue with the x app formerly twitter where it freezes when i try to send direct messages to specific users the app gets stuck forcing me to close it ive tried clearing cache reinstalling and updating but the problem remains everything works fine on the browser due to this persistent bug im dropping my rating to one star please fix this issue as it affects core functionality
it was good when i downloaded it months and months ago but recently its full of bugs and lags idk whats the reason ive updated it uninstalled and reinstalled it but nothings changing my wifi is fine but it keeps on saying something went wrong please fix this
still no fix for my problem the apps cant load any post in my timeline since the takeover from jack dorsey sometimes it worked properly and then stuck loading no text no picture for a long time maybe hours i thought because im not paying for the apps even tho finally i paid for basic subscribtion you still owe me to fix this problem i always update the apps and waiting for almost a year but youre not listening please if you cant i wanted a refund for my basic subscribtion
something isnt right try you request again later this message is regular while opening x i use x everyday regularly update it also cleared cache data uninstalled twice or thrice but still the issue persist my phone is a newer one bought barely few months ago so nothing wrong in here hope the concern personnel sort this issue pretty quick ratings are already down due bad algorithm alongwith the auto refresh thing hope ratings doesnt lower anymore
i dont think ive seen an app so consistently terrible app barely works half of the time and changes to features are either insignificant or actively make the app worse bots and spam are still a major problem monetization and ads are invasive and scummy with the removal of block functionality the platform is actively hostile to users everyone on board at x deserves to be fired immediately
wont work when mobile is charging pictures and videos struggle to work move away from the app for a small amount of time and it will auto refresh my feed and i lose what i was looking at nothing but spam bots commenting on every post news feed doesnt work spammed by posts from accounts i dont follow cant see posts from accounts i do follow too many ads everywhere on the app every update seems to make it worse
the block button doesnt work at all anymore people i block can still see my posts id say its more like mute now but when i block someone their reply reappears seconds after i go to their profile and turns out they arent blocked anymore this happens all the time so at this point the mute button is more useful which is insane you need to take this app off the play store as it breaks the rules for social media apps due to no longer having a working block button
app has become useless days on end without refreshing the more you say you arent interested in a post the more x wants to show you just like it updates fix nothing only makes problems worse elon can barely run this app what makes people think he can run a fake government department
too many bugs even after updating experience of using the app has gone down tremendously videos do not load page does not refresh despite having a proper connection with fast wifi app freezes videos play in background even after closing does not load new pages lots of times so sad to see this app getting ruined due to such bad interface
a bug where the sound of a video ive played keep replaying even after i opened another video or close the app i need to remove app from the background for the sound to be off and the bug have been exist since months ago another useless update doesnt make any experience with this app any better
while im trying to read a story it refreshes and moves it off screen every few seconds i have eye problems that require me to pause and focus and i can barely read a single story from the for you page i really want to support x but i cant read it
the experience on x is worst nowadays app is closing on its own while we tweeting something or messaging someone and when we go to message section can not retrieve message show again and again despite that messages are showing same content on timeline is coming again and again even when we refresh the feed its so irritating and tiresome
x is one of the best apps on ios but falls short on android i use it on both my iphone and pixel and the android version isnt as polished as its ios counterpart this app is a musthave for anyone interested in world affairs or seeking instant updates on developments across all areas of life it offers live broadcasts and realtime updates for diverse interests while the ios app deserves five stars the android version gets four stars due to its comparatively lesser experience
i just signed up for a new account id like to update the profile but theres a popup that says profile update failed im not a bot and the way introduced to the help center is not gon na help i cant get through to the rescue center you keep spamming for help via dm subscribe to x premium messages should i report xs support as spam first
its getting worse dms like to froze photos and video takes longer to load too many unnecessary and inappropriate ads the bot problem doesnt even resolved and now block button still makes our post visible to the account that we blocked hello its getting unusable day by day imma giving it zero star if theres the option
by far this is the worst social media platform i have ever used it is so slow and unstable as compared to other apps like instagram or facebook the video call and voice call also didnt work properly and midconversation it always suddenly says not corresponding this is so unprofessional and unethical please fix this annoying issues thank you and not to mention my network connection is always stable so its not my fault its your fault
the algorithm seems to regularly throw in random unrelated inflammatory posts that i have no interest in seeing its for this reason why i can barely use the app for half an hour let alone a full one though the way some basic social media features work here are also not great such as the block feature among many others
its really annoying when the video automatically changes when it ends it feels like instagram reels or youtube shorts its annoying because i want to watch that video again and again until i want to change itself its not youtube shorts or instagram reels why does it change automatically i want to watch that video peacefully like before
twitter used to be a lightweight app x is now heavy and lagging its like dragging heavy stones around other apps feel like the speed of light after some time on x maybe only google play is slower i believe free accounts are being slowed down and restricted to force subscribing to premium same reason why i have abandoned meta with the same posts i get views on instagram on x and thousands on pinterest
app is great and community notes is fantastic currently having an issue where the app will sometimes not load any data from servers even after clearing cache and force closing the program rebooting the device doesnt work either if this can be fixed the app would be star update sept th connection issue has not improved update october th connection issue has not improved lowing rating to two stars as this makes the app unusable at times nov th issue has gotten significantly worse
well i like x its content along with its commitment to truth and free speech thats a great breakthrough considering the standard and culture of contemporary media thats fast losing its credibility and utility so in the new emerging media horizon x has the opportunity to evolve better and better only to shine with the trust respect and dignity that journalism journalists used to command once upon a timeall this needs constant selfanalysis selfcorrection and continuously reinventing
please bring back the feature of not refreshing the timeline automatically and showing a small new posts buttonaction on top which refreshes the timeline when clicked right now im regretting that i updated the app because the timeline keeps getting refreshed every seconds
paid for premium not plus can not edit posts or download videos originally couldnt post more than characters reached out to support and now i can but still having issues elsewhere also ads are still largely shown on my timeline while scrolling
this app was dead previously the app was closing simultaneously faced factor authentication in this app many times always telling my code is wrong now i can not able to open it and log in it people who are using this app better you delete this app and use it in google or chrome browser itself i am in installing it rest in peace to this x app
i love the new version of the app its absolutely amazing the freedom of speech is just perfect one can say whatever they like as long as theyre not hurting anyone or creating any form of violence before it was just outrageous i love it and the new promotion standard is perfect the ads in the fact that i can easily make money without stress over petty things has just been passed i love it everything about it is amazing and that i can host my own task is also very cool very recordi
i dont get why every app has to be so horrible i search forever for names that i really like and when i finally decide to change it they only tell me im rate limited and wont let me pick the rare name i have which means someone else might take it before me now so ridiculous bot checker is impossible when creating it denies also when you try to back out after searching something it goes one page back at a time frustrating
just installed this stupid app i posted twits when i wanted to post another one i kept getting this wierd error failed to send post i reinstalled the app and also tried the web version but none of them worked i did some research about the issue and it seems like its happening to many users still no one knows why and theres literally no way to contact twitter on the issue ive never seen such week customer service on an app before im switching to tumblr and recommended you to do so
no app is perfect thats why i gave stars it is a very nice social and communication platform i get the news headlines notification of events advertisement of goods and services and many more i enjoyed it but having to pay have weaken my knees since i am not an advertiser
ive been on twitter since and only within the recent acquisition has this app been worse it has derailed into a broken garbagefilled shameful husk of what it once was this application no longer works when your android device is charging it is riddled with content that has nothing to do with you or your interests even on the for you page and is just devolving in realtime i miss using twitter not this abysmal waste of software
worst app crashes every time i use even though my mobile data and wifi is at a good speed it crashes every time i uses getting very irritated even i uninstalled and installed many time cant able to sort out the issue not even good respone from sever teamplease sort out this issue x customer service team
the app perpetually fails to load even when there are no network issues i would see the same ad again and again mere tweets apart and in the replies of every tweet the replies are full of unrelated content because only verified accounts are shown first there are so many polarizing tweets from verified account just so that they can get interactions and make money there is slowly no point being on this app
very good can be improved ability to bold words not lose format when copy and paste to another post when watching videos landscape on my samsung tab s i can not see shortcuts to comment repost share etc when i rotate to portrait they are there should be able to tag someone to highlight a post to someone not repost less disc space
you can not trust the platform verification system advertising reach is not verifiable and too many fake accounts to many ads with overmonetization too many porn and dating fake websites with fake accounts too much onesided censorship they want you to pay for verification checkmark each month as a subscription you can no longer see general timelines only from those you have followed i moved to bluesky tribel which is free and a lot nicer platforms x is full of scammers and fakes
i rated this star because the update is very disappointing all the videos dont play and even when they do they only play for seconds ive tried refreshing the app and reinstalling it but nothing works please kindly fix this immediately
crashes after minutes of browsing deletes message history at random intervals animations are on steroids and the app is not intuitive in any way shape or form itll get stars if the recurring crashing and dm deletion bugs get fixed
reasons for star rating new block update breaks googles privacy policy sometimes when my internet is working perfectly fine it takes a couple minutes at least to load tweets when i first open the app grok option being toggled on by default is also unconsented especially by creators on the site unnecessary amounts of ai bots everywhere i see less real conversations in replies these days
the application can not be opened when charging opening photosvideos and comments takes a very long time adding bookmarks takes a very long time switching accounts requires closing the application first i thought was an upgrade from twitter but it turned out to be a very big downgrade
very slow in loading all media whereas could instantly see all the media in my youtube for you page auto refreshed is not needed as that cause users to miss interested things for them as it is very difficult to return to the previous posts let users choose when to refresh their own for you page
it was a fine app when it was the original logo and things were awesome but now its gotten way out of hand with the fact that this guy named e m had to be forced with changing the logo to x the layout is all in black it doesnt look very appealing to me more bugs could be fixed also the layout could be different so this is probably the last time i will be on x forever
there wasnt really anything wrong with twitter it was well moderated totally free ads and bots were minimal you always saw the most liked reply to a post first now all the people with the least to say and bots pay to get their engagement boosted there are even ads in the replies no quality standards i kept having violence against animals and people appear on my for you page seeing an image of a mutilated child on this app was unthinkable two years ago but not anymore awful
the servers on mobile are literally unusable you need to constantly restart the app in order for you to be able to use the basic function of reloading your feed or even just searching please fix whatever you have done as this only became an issue after rebranding from twitter
the app itself is clean and welldesigned with an intuitive ui the massive amount of adds every three tweets is absolutely unbearable not to mention when theyre inappropriately placed between mourning tweets of the dead and their families lawlessness
editing my rating cause my homepages now bland my feed became repetitive and refreshes every minutes making it hard to find content i like back then i find better content by stalking my oomfs likes now i cant even see it some users likes post instead of retweet to make their page clean but now its unorganized also the sounds of a video i scrolled would still play in the bg the sounds overlap with another vid and its annoying to hear most importantly fuc ai i didnt consent to it
frequent trouble loading feed in ideal network circumstances features that are annoying and disruptive changes made with little to no forethought bots are everywhere and nothing is done about them extremistracistnazi content is impossible to avoid despite me trying my best to block all of it i see ads are embedded and its impossible to remove ads that may be offensive or inappropriate and despite selflabeling as a free speech app poking fun at elon gets you suspended or banned
until they fix all the lag and bugs especially the stupid auto refresh feed which jump while in the middle of reading tweets i wont pay for a subscription poor quality boated buggy software now with more ads than tweets mostly selling illegal products and porn google should remove it from the play store play protect isnt working
blocking is not blocking anymore instead of giving you the option to hide likes if you want everyones likes are now fully hidden twitter always had bots but since it became x you cant go into a single post without seeing bots a lot of content is moderated while somehow worse is shown
i like the app but it doesnt work very well when i put my phone on charge nothing loads i just get a loading circle even when i take it off charge i have to restart the app to get it to load any pages ive searched online and this seems to be an android problem
its an ok app but it would be even better if it didnt take so much space in my phone i have an sd card and mostly all of my apps get transferred to it but this app doesnt transfer and im pretty disappointed by it reinstalled when i heard that elon had made some changes i think its doing much better now havent had any memory issues on my phones either so thats cool keep up the good work
this app gets worse day by day aggressive shortsighted policy changes have lead to most of my friends abandoning it the only ads i get are for scummy crypto garbage and there are times where every other tweet is an ad more and more the only people still using this app are the ones trapped there by a business like me or the types of people who arent allowed at family get togethers anymore an absolute wasteland and a shadow of its former self
its a crapshoot whether or not ill be able to actually use the app at any given time the bots are outrageous the algorithm is incredibly biased with the ads it shows you and the enforcing of policies seems to be random at best
i am extremely disappointed with x my premium account was suddenly suspended without any prior warning or explanation despite reaching out to their support team multiple times i received vague or automated responses that provided no clarity on the reason for the suspension this lack of transparency and poor communication is unacceptable especially for a platform that prides itself on user trust i can no longer recommend x to anyone as their treatment of customers is unprofessional
x formerly twitter is great for sharing diverse content and engaging in realtime discussions on various topics its a goto for news and trending conversations however the algorithm can prioritize suggested content over what you follow and misinformation or negative interactions can be issues the push for monetization has also received mixed feedback
a lot of very questionable choices have been made over the past few months and it now feels like the platform is acting based on the formula of every stereotypical super villain trying to achieve world domination luckily there are better alternatives such as bluesky
the quality of this app and social space has diminished over the past year and a half the user interface is terrible currently its full of ads after every other tweet now it does not allow you to stay permanently blocked from the people you have blocked im pretty sure theres a violates googles terms and conditions
app is not responding it keeps getting close or keep getting hanged images and videos are not getting uploaded and im unable to watch videos as it keep getting paused and images are taking too long to be download latest post arent showing pls update your app stop making hard for users to use this app
latest android version as the previous version is constantly crashing fed up clearing the cache clearing data and having to then stop the app only to restart it and experience the crashing all over again a few minutes later awful
i avoided updating the app but google changed my settings without my permission and the app was updated now there are temu ads every where every posts and like every videos ads are in replies and if you dismiss them you get kicked out of the thread also you can no longer block most advertisers its a miserable ugly experience its less than one star
this app is pissing me off i use this app since but in this year alone i notice that the app is so trashy because the bugs and error and ads is slowly pissing me off coz i just want to scrolling down to read a new tweets or wh news but it can not coz this app have too many bugs and error and slow im sorry its just makes me so angry that my favorite app is slowly being trahy app
i have an issue with twitter logging me out when i close the app when i attempt to log in at this screen it gives me an error but if i end the twitter task and reopen ill be properly logged in this has been happening since early june throughout updates
i love x my favorite platform but man does the app need some work it will not load videos some times i will constantly ge to the bottom of the list and will straight up not load all at times elon needs to kick the x android team into high gear
used to use this app for everything but since its become x its become rubbish when you say you dont like a certain post it will continue to show it anyway crashes on me atleast twice a day for a minimum of hours each time overall rank compared to how it used to be
since the elon takeover all kinds of stuff is broken sending media of any kind is a real challenge and in dms its typically impossible particularly as far as gifs are concerned message not sent over and over for no reason very frustrating seemingly no interest in fixing anything on the elon side either update theres hardly anything left on twitter other than ai accounts typing nonsense and farright propaganda occupying most of the ad spaces its a cancerous garbage app
my dms are full of messages from spam bots every th post or so is an ad mostly for crypto stuff for some reason its never been something ive shown interest in ragebait posts get pushed up by the algorithm in order to increase engagement posts with hate speech andor blatant misinformation stay up even when reported the app keeps getting worse and worse
the app is good but unfortunately i am experiencing a problem while using the app the videos are not playing and when i react the videos sometimes it wont pop up on the screen if i already press the heart button or not hipe youll do something about this
about of the time it wont load and ends up crashing it doesnt work on android when charging moderate the app better people wishing deathviolence and glorifying peoples deaths arent banable neither is spreading dangerous misinformation the recent ban change basically encourages harassment bots have gotten worse while claiming to have gotten better this app has changed for the worse over this past year
twitter is in a downward spiral like ive never seen in any other too big to fail company yet so far the app is a buggy broken mess random refreshes bots everywhere removal of core features blocking circles etc doesnt work while phone is charging and more the current owner seems to care nothing more than to force his political ideologies on its users and it serves as an ego project more than caring about community and sustainability used to be my most used app no longer
does not load about of the time sometimes after a few restarts it will other times it just wont load for anywhere between minutes to an hours content also has gotten really gone downhill as of late a lot more bots spam and hatefilled replies
i previously gave the app five stars however i have been having trouble with the app when i open the app then try and read anything it shows the header but if i want to read the article it doesnt load or if i want to read comments it just wont load or takes a really long time to download to view anything sometimes i have no problem but more often than not it doesnt work correctly i thought it was my network but i have no problem if i go to any other app
unable to add phone number to my account no matter what i do ive watched multiple tutorials and tried multiple methods devices but it still shows errors whenever i type my phone number and whenever i send verification code i logged in to twitter after i received an email saying that someone got access to my twitter account i rushed and immediately changed password of my twitter account then i went to add a phone number to my account after hours but twitter doesnt let me do so
the service itself is unmatched for news and events community notes is the best feature ever conceived for social media the android app could use some polishing though the home button should be in the center to facilitate left or right handed people also there are occasional crashes which is annoying
i absolutely love x but i cant give it more than one star because every time i open the app there is a post that im interested in and then the app automatically refreshes my feed and i lose that post forever you dont need to keep me engaged i use this app regularly everyday stop refreshing my feed i will do that myself
twitter was a great app x is unfortunately a trash site what used to be filled with intelligent conversations and content is now only clickbait and people all trying to get paid off each other in engagement its also pay to win which is concerning as its advertised as a news site but your news will only be seen if you pay for a blue check rip twitter we will remember you fondly
for some reason the application stops working completely and i am unable to lootlk any posts from anybody or refresh my feed and and i can see already loaded posts but and i cant see the images of videos themselves and this lingers for hours please fix this bug
everybody hates this site on a moral level but i find it important to remember that x sucks in a mechanical level too bookmarks cant be organized for you and following keep showing randos you disagree with and dms are full of bots though my personal least favorite aspect are purple star notifications worst app dont recommend
the current update is horrible also not being able to get notifications when people follow or being able to follow back also i cant see all of the tweets on my timeline and there are a lot of crashes and bugs its horrible there is a lot of political propaganda threads is better
exceptional although they suspended our account as spam which of course is an error still havent been able to appeal that part is tough getting real news from people is awesome still posting from other account hoping to get our premium verified account back
the app has dropped in quality significantly compared to where it was a couple years ago prior to the rebrand if the ownership changes and the app moves back to this previous state it could be redeemed but in its current state it is not worth using
pretty good app most big companies used this app to upload their product news been using this app for months i was able to catch up with my favourite stuff but then disaster strike sometimes imagesvideos were not loading and sometime the loading screen did nothing like its stuck most annoying bug really appreciate it if you guys can fix it real quick
unbelievable the new block function that actually dont block anything im sure this is prohibited somehow also no words to consistently problems where the app dont load any content and only the browser works this app is terrible
you just lose connection randomly other apps on my phone are working just fine but with this one it will at times not load as if you have connectivity issues while you dont its frustrating coz you will miss out on certain posts that you had interest on
it wont let me update my profile picture and fails to post my posts support is not contactable it just takes you in circles and circles help topics do not match request already tried updating uninstalling and reinstalling does it on all of my accounts
never see my stuff anymore algorithm doesnt even exist i dont think videos dont load pictures dont load the page constantly freezes as im scrolling and says start your timeline as if i havent had this account for years just a horrible app all around
i am rapidly losing it with this app i manage a few x accts accts professionaly its my job the app will crash dozens of times a day making it difficult to post i love the platform but you must fix whatever bug makes it crash it happens dozens of times a day even dozens of times whike trying to write a post and its not my devices it happens across devices including brand new devices this is a poor way to treat ppl who rely on the platform for an income please fix it
love hate relationship kind of thing i am only leaving a review now after a long time of use i got the app twitter back when i hear elon was in the final stages of purchase negotiations it came a long way in this time but has still done the left right paradigm thing still a hell of a lot better as you can actually search and find but the constant reseting refreshing and automatic log outs is ridiculous to the point it is unreliable for anything other than brain dead scrolling android
i have been a member of x community from august last monday i took the basic premium membership from last two days my account has been blocked due to reasons unknown to me i have tried connecting with the support but no help from their side this is not acceptable i either want my subscription money back or you can unblock my account
i block users mostly bots to not see their stuff and this app is trying to remove the block function because the current owner of the app is being blocked by many of its users fairly might i add not to mention the experience of this app is just terrible with ad after ad im seeing more of them than actual human beings and this here was meant to be a social media app
this app is now ruined with long vertical adds that play video my whole timeline is glitching while loading those ads and the app is constantly crashing its literally unusable what a shame i really enjoyed twitter over the years
this platform has become a husk of its former self its a cesspool of hate bigotry delivered to your feed by an algorithm that promotes bots crooks liars at the expense of the rest of us ads are relentlessly pushed many from obvious scammers the autorefresh stops any meaningful scrolling as soon as something interesting comes into view it disappears replaced by yet more ads bigotry the block feature is now useless dump it install bluesky instead you wont regret it
ever since musk cleaned up x has become a lot more enjoyable and its now my preferred social medium the only issues i keep having are chat related where when i spend some time chatting in group chats the app randomly closes the chat and deletes the message draft which is very annoying i get recommended to clean cache but it doesnt usually work too well otherwise everything is aokay one more thing we should be able to schedule posts on mobile too
premium plus subscription did nothing wrong engaged community with hardly any engagement stats then i get a shadow ban premium plus with nothing done again guidelines and limited access to the account result cancelled subscription deactivated account now deleting app so long morons
twitterx has going further and further downhill in terms of usability bots take up a great deal of the content now this is because the app algorithmically boosts paid content meaning botters buy suscriptions to force themselves into your feed there is little to no organic content anymore on the platform
only good feature left to be added is a sliding scroll bar at right side when we see media on anyones x account if someones account has thousands of media then a scroll bar is necessary which can take me to the very first media post in one touch
they will suspend you for absolutely no reason or just cause and then never respond to any contact no explanation and no responses this is discussed by many users on reddit and others discussing similar on various forums and even in x itself the only way to receive assistance is to have a large account with many followers etc in which case someone may help hopefully something will change with time but currently things are a mess and x is unwilling to help or respond
im editing my review and giving stars why would i open a post and when i go back to the homepage everything refreshed and i lost the several posts on the timeline this happened after the last update i shouldnt have updated
ive never experienced any major problems with this app and i use it a decent amount but for some reason x wont allow me to look back into conversations i had with people days ago im in a group chat and can only see what was just sent it wont let me go any further back than today
ai no optout it sucks that their planning on using anybodies posts to train their ai and put anywhere they want into the world as said in their new terms and conditions its an invasion of privacy to not give people the choice to opt out a lot of people are swapping apps because of this everybody stay aware and stay safe on the internet
it is becoming uncomfortable and unsafe to use the new updates are making the app uninteresting and stressful it glitches and just stops multiple times a day plus now when you block someone they can still see everything about you
annoying prior to the us elections elon musks posts keeps showing in my feed even though i dont care of their elections since i dont live there i opted the see less often many times but it just keeps showing and showing especially when elections date was getting close and its very annoying the owner is really abusing his power in this platform horrible experience
no real customer support cant find anything on the issue im experiencing i changed a setting on my profile and now every page has the messages can not retrieve posts at this time please try again later followed by something isnt right try your request again later pop up and nothing loads
after watching a few videos the sound of the last watched video plays on the new video at the same time and its very annoying i have to close the program completely clear the cache and run x again this error happens every day i installed the latest update
suddenly my push notifications are silent ive reset all my settings ive followed everything online and still my push notifications dont seem to make a sound only on this app everything else works fine except for push notifications why
buggy and sometimes unusable feed randomly refreshes algorithm is absolutely wild at times where stuff youd never imagine to see randomly pops up also the ads are borderline henti and they come up every other post
too much of bugs causing the app to be highly unstable it has become the worst piece of junk one of the bizzare apps it has become everytime i log out to log in it always says something went wrong
earlier all the users who worked hard through add revenue were getting good payouts but now x has started a new active program called creator revenue sharing in which even after a lot of hard work many people have not received their payouts and if someone has received it it is around or meaning they have received only the premium money and in nigeria users have not even received the payout equivalent to the premium money the users there are filing complaints and many users have
why does the app hang so often the page doesnt refresh the replies dont open the media doesnt load this happens at least twice everyday no way is it a wifi issue when every other app is working fine
a lot of people seem to be leaving negative reviews due to politics which is simply childish seriously grow up im going to actually rate the app itself ive not had any connectivity problems no loading issues nothing like that i agree i dont like the videos autoplaying compared to other social media platforms you can speak freely which i guess some dont like there are community notes to fact check which is good the for you page could definitely be better its hit or miss
ive been recently having an awful time with twitter x the algorithm is pushing content im not interested in and the constant changes have made the app unappealing ill be switching to different apps that perform better and care about user experience
not a comment on content which needs a full essay the app itself is getting worse nothing will get loaded around midnight every single night refresh never worksd the feed often doesnt update when launching the app and needed repeated refresh
i cant even read tweet its keep crashing it happens when i see the f whiteout survival ad i literally cant read tweet it stoped then crashed and the same every time i open the app my phone not that old and every app works fine except x
x is one of the best apps to catch up on the latest scoop and communicate with different people from across the world depending on who people follow a copious amount of information that would otherwise not be found on any other platform or informatiom that is otherwise suppressed is on x i have yet to be officially banned from using the app in its entirety i highly recommend downloading x for anyone who wants to access information quickly and be provided concise updates for various stories
hello x support in the android app each time i open an image or replies and go back the page refreshes instead of returning to its previous state could you look into this for a smoother experience thanks
tones of bugs it wont load any posts while my phone charges randomly stops loading feed in general will randomly refresh my feed when i am reading something and the only ads i am seeing are for the same nonexistent phone games and crypto scams
ever since it updated from twitter to x the app had been crashing way too frequently updated it a few days ago and every time i open the app it requires my login details it loads then goes back to the login page accessing my twitter is now a nightmare
the application is crashing every few minutes particularly when there are videos or adverts the phones app draw also does often not load blank list of all my apps this usually is resolved when i close a window google x
aside from the stupid rebrand riddled with bots and spam feedback on ads seems to just be ignored and your spammed with ads that have no relevance feature like search only occasionally work huge numbers of fake profiles absolute dumpster fire of an app avoid at all costs
frustrating audio bug urgent fix needed when i scroll to the next video or minimize the app the audio from the previously played video continues to play overlapping with the new videos audio this creates a frustrating and confusing experience expected behavior audio should stop when user scrolls to the next video app is minimized request developers please prioritize fixing this bug its essential for a seamless user experience
the app still has problems from months ago not fixed crashes when in dms and timelinevideos not loading if you want to use twitter on android just use the browser works great on chrome cant believe the android app is still this awful
app crashes and stops loading randomly have to close and force stop the app and it doesnt always resolve it occasionally have to resort to restarting phone to get the x app to work no other app has this problem
my experience was going good but suddenly only in my account in the search section im seeing some stories instead of the hastags in every sections which im not liking at all and when i tried to reach out to help center it is not letting me address my issue this is pathetic this is the reason im rating it star else i wouldve given stars in rating if the issue is resolved i will update the rating
the new block feature is a joke it still allows the person to see your profile and everything you post they just cant interact with said posts so youre not even blocking the person its just basically as of you limited who can and who cant interact with your posts meaning there is no more functional block feature on the app
do not pay for an x premium account i recently purchased x premium plus for a year it took three days to get my blue check i had it one day before my account was permanently suspended it didnt even give me a reason for my suspension customer service sucks and is online only and i have yet to get a response from them x also refuses to refund your money
useless app for reading the news telegram is much better and more logical x feels like a madhouse where lunatics shout slogans and youre supposed to choose which one you like best moreover x still has censorship that operates cluelessly without understanding context plus you have to wait forever for that blue checkmarkthey take your money and then youre stuck waiting waiting for the checkmark for someone to review your perfectly fine comment etc absolutely disgusting
this app just doesnt care about privacy with this new block change almost every social media platform that i know which has a block button also blocks an user from viewing your posts preventing stalkers or such x does not do that and just does not care about online harrassment even if the person cant interact with you users do not sign up and developers revert this change
it would be better if it didnt play videos all at once instead of preferably one that it would allow me to make changes in of my profile because when i do it it suddenly goes back to how it was as if i hadnt changed anything and that it wouldnt randomly refresh my tl
the app itself decided to update the usage of the blocking function which is against the rules of google play basically making the block button pointless the updated blocking function will also be taken advantage of by stalkers and strangers on the internet if anything i highly dont recommend downloading this trashy app
this app on its most basic features doesnt let you edit a post or comment if you make one typo the block function was wiped entirely so its just mute now ads stalk relentlessly even if you mute them muting phrases from my timeline is worthless because those certain posts are still there i did not create an account to see an endless stream of political garbage i created one to follow those who make art or my favorite music covers im being booted after blocking accounts
amongst many many issues with this appsite the most recent change thats stupid is the block button no longer really blocks its more effectively a mute button anyone can view your tweets but are no longer able to interact other wise its not like they couldnt view it logged out or with an alt account but it is still a stupid change
nowadays the app gets logged out automatically if i dont use it for at least day of course it shouldnt happen and also when i try to login again then it shows that my account has been seen to be logged in so many times which they consider as a suspecious activity that it can not allow me now to log in and to try after some time this provides me a bad experience i use the x app on my galaxy s fe update sep
ever since its purchase and rebranding the app is a slog to use loading times are often astronomical or stuff just doesnt load the apps moderators also openly favor us right wing politics and if you dont follow them and or openly oppose them you can get suspended absolutely dogshit development basic coding elements such as an error message not showing up again after its already displayed is not present unless it gets reverted or rerebranded i wouldnt recommend making an x account
edit for the nth time photos loads too slow and videos keeps on stopped playing or not even played at all and can you please bring back the diff color themes making the blue a permanent color is not good i want my purple and pink back
as someone who was harassed as a child i would like to know why you think removing critical privacysafety features is a good idea the purpose of blocking is to stop someone from being able to interact in any way allowing a blocked user to see your posts defeats the whole purpose i would seriously reevaluate your idea of how to help users protect themselves because this is definitely not the way to do it
the app is terrible not only does it restrict basic functions behind a paywall it also locked my account because i liked too many posts and there is no way for me to get the account back the app is full of bugs and glitches rubs advertisements into your face and gives you horrible feed recommendations
the app seems to use bad server quality in india making it too slow to use i have to use web browser to use the website at times i hope they will work on the servers to make the app smoother further extreme racism against india is making the app nonusable the app used to be a great source of news and current affairs but the current algorithm promotes racism and it keeps showing up in feed a large number of racist posts are getting circulated that are against ethical human behaviour
borderline unusable the comment sections are filled with bots almost every other post on the timeline is an ad and most of the promoted posts and accounts are right wing grifters who are not only allowed to say the most vile things imaginable but are often encouraged to do so avoid this app at all costs and if you already have it i suggest uninstalling it save yourself the negativity and frustration
crashes scrolling through your feed and it just sort of restarts and brings you back to home page apart from being a platform for unbiased and alternative news the performance of the app is below par
audio keeps playing even after closing the app clearing running apps wont work nor will clearing x app cache will make the audio stop only way is to restart the phone or clear app data altogether please resolve this
this app has just gone downhill like crazy in the past year aside from all the other pointless updates and changes now its been made to where anyone you have blocked can still see your posts but not interact and vice versa aside from the harassment aspect of this i dont want to see the content of people i have blocked this is absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary the app is just being made unpleasant and unenjoyable for no reason please undo these silly updates
a lot of performance issues also hate the idea of ads on even a sec clip login step is made complicated for no reason whatsoever overall app experience ihas taken a major hit
when it was twitter i had no issues ever since i updated it to x which is like a year ago it sometimes never updates my feed and doesnt load any media etc its so annoying even when i update it in hopes itll have improved but still the same
app is buggy and innundated with inappropriate ads also inappropriate language is allowed and rampant throughout and unsafe from the n r other slurs and degrading language to people blocked to be visible i also hope that they figure out how to keep someone blocked to viewing content and also to moderate better
hello hmm everything is ok no problem but the notifications i can see some notifications on my notification panel from x for my interested post them i will go to the x to check them then boom there is no notification in the notification tab i dont know what the problem i can see or notification number at the app icon but still there is nothing in it
tweets are infested with bots and reporting them is futile loading videos and photos takes a lot of time regardless of internet speed multiple videos always play at the same time when scrolling through the feed putting limits on viewing tweets is awful as well moreover viewing likes help me discover new accounts and content while reposting exists making likes private limits users on knowing related content from their followed accounts
app freezes a lot to the point that i have to constantly switch networks and restart the app for it to work again there are a lot of bots and my feed usually doesnt represent my interests they are introducing a lot of cuestionable policies regarding privacy and ai plus some features have been hidden behind a pay wall
oh my god this app gets worse every time i look at it wan na replay a short video cause you missed something too bad heres an ad and now the apps refreshed and the video is gone wan na scroll and look at the next post too bad the apps refreshed itself and that post id forever lost youll never see it again i hate this app and i hate that so many people use it for announcements and updates i wish i could give it less than one star
ive been a user since and this app just isnt the same since musk bought itmy main issue is that it will freeze up every day multiple times its ridiculous and i might uninstall because of this bug
never have i ever had a dull moment using this application it allows me to not only use my own voice but helps me to think creatively and challenge myself and my knowledge for both personal growth and enjoyment i never have to censor what i write which is important in this day and age in which so many people are micromanaged when it comes to speaking out andor speaking up theres something powerful in using your own voice without censorship ty for the opportunity whoot whoot
x deserves a fivestar rating for its exceptional performance and user experience its fast stable and delivers content efficiently making it ideal for those seeking substance over selfies unlike other platforms x fosters informed discussions and realtime updates without the typical social media vanity its interface is clean intuitive and focused on engagement over ego for anyone tired of narcissistic social media x stands out as the best app by far
after years of not a buffer one all the app does now is buffer more than load what the hell happened can not post or scroll with charger plugged in works fine when unplugged is there a fix for this new problem
twitter has become a glorified ads board where the advertisements takes the whole of your phone screen plus the constant bugs and glitches now with the blocking feature that doesnt really blocks people it has become a mu husk of what it used to be
wow i am surprised to see how far low this app has gone since a certain someone took over i left twitter long ago and literally only have this installed to see some fun stuff my friends will occasionally find and dm me but now thats barely even usable as every time i open the app itll crash multiple times in a row just cause i wanted to watch a video or sometimes literally anything just earlier the app instantly crashed times in a row upon opening and after that fit it worked
i rarely leave reviews but this app used to be functional and now everything is a pain it is constantly telling me to try again later messages wont load notifications duplicate it just wont load ever and i am constantly having to kill it and reopen and that doesnt even work like of the time
it used to be fine but lately has been very erratic it will randomly shift the tweet list to the top sometimes shut down and when it does my on screen app icons vanish but soon return
this is probably the dumbest app to get back into your account when you dont remember your details i sent an email received back response saying email doesnt match any on file then says weve received notice of someone trying to change password on that same email they said didnt match any on file done with the app its not worth the headache i do not recommend this app
make the app work with android password management apis if it works with lockwise and bitwarden you should be good publish your data privacy statement without it the play store no longer shows what data you have access to are you reading what apps i have installed what carrier i have what devices on on my wifi network i have no idea and thats bad
the ads are making the entire app lag even after turning off autoplay for videos recently saw ads consecutively after each other which is nonsense i reactivated my account more than days ago and my follower and following count has been sitting on zero this has never happened before and it shouldnt take that long for my original follower and following count to appear
these new updates are just horrible i dont even need to get into which new updates because almost all of them are just awful i cant name a single recent update that has done any good for the app but to be a little specific i dont much like the idea of my posts which contain my own art sometimes being used to train an ai by default i wasnt even informed and the option to turn it off was hidden a little its almost like they knew a lot of people wouldnt agree to it hm
completely full of spam bots these days the subscription to remove ads is a month which is a joke when you compare it to other better apps ad free options like youtube premium you also dont see your friends posts unless you are all paying for one of the overpriced subscriptions it suppresses anyone who uses it as a free app
got locked out of one of my accounts as it was asking for an email verification even though i have my phone number linked to it i dont have access to that email anymore so now all my information is up another account is suspended and i cant delete twitter support is all automated and of no help horrible privacy for this app someone should take it to court
the current owner recently decided to remove the functionality of the block button which last time i checked is not entirely legal i use this app in the same way i do other social media platforms and if im unable to block people to protect myself from content and profiles i consider dangerous then i no longer feel safe using this app
for the past two years this app has crashed and forced logouts regularly and it has become a bot haven for engagementfarming abusive ads and malicious links while the devs refuse to do anything about this evergrowing issue and with the update rolling out this week you cant even block accounts to protect your data as blocking wont prevent others bots or otherwise from seeing your posts add an algorithm that favors the apps owner specifically and you have a recipe for disaster
so bad experience for android users please fix the background audio thing that is whenever i switch to trending tab from home page in the background homepage audio is still playing and also in the news feed whenever i open nd or rd title the posts shown beneath then are of the st title news fix this also in theatre mode the screem is too zoomed in you should allow the user to choose how much zoom does he want for the video fix this things
screen reader accessibility is broken sometimes it will act as if it is reading a post from several pages up this also means it messes up names on the following or followers lists basically unusable if you scroll down more than posts or so without restarting the app
this app is booty it doesnt give you any notification that it needs an update because if you dont update it you cant use it say if i just got home and i connected to the wifi and i click on this app its not going to load up
as an android user this apps reliability is non existent as well as still not having the same features as iphone usersso new updates often crash the app or u get a weird error today voice messages are not consistently working in dmslast update for dm blocking that us android users dont get crashed my dms until they sent out an update to fix it this app is severely unreliable and needs to be updated to include android users
x stands out as the best social app steering clear of the random videos and irrelevant ads that flood the blue app kudos to elon and the x team for championing free speech users can express themselves freely without feeling restricted and theres minimal censorship on the app one issue though videos occasionally freeze and sometimes audio from multiple videos plays at once it would be great if the team could address this bug
enjoy using x i love the option to see the latest from those i follow and the for me section that the algorithm throws together however id like to experience more mixing with the algorithm theres a lot of reposting containing the same exact info that gets annoying overall its a great app i visit x multiple times a day and will continue supporting a free speech platform
i do find it more centered and accessible than it was before although im not happy about the block change and grok reading pictures without your consent so only stars sorry
a lot better under new management but technical issues are definitely more prevalent a couple useful features like turning off autoplay for videos are lacking hugely useful valuable app
this app crashes at least once if not multiple times a day edit most of the apps functions simply dont its if a video is going to load the feed rarely loads so many posts have never been posted because they just go into the abyss my dms have completely stopped working its fine on my laptop but this app is garbage
i love using x though i still miss calling it twitter its amazing how we can post just about anythingfrom random thoughts to important updatesand connect with people worldwide theres something freeing about sharing ideas and seeing different perspectives whether im expressing myself or just following the latest trends x gives me a space to be myself its like having a voice that anyone can hear every time i open the app i feel a mix of excitement
a journey with the x app ive been with the x app from the beginning and it has truly evolved into something remarkable its sleek design and userfriendly interface makes for essy use the features are well thought out and continually improve making my daily news reading easier i love the auto progress feature i highly recommend the x app to anyone looking for unfiltered news its become my most used app
often the app wont work in many instances for example often at night the whole app stops working and i cant scroll further in addition when videos would be playing itll sometimes just stop when i didnt hit the pause button and when i try to continue it it wont load and keeps stopping at a certain time point
due to there is always room for improvement ive recently been having a issue as i scroll the videos i would come across an ad vid and flick past but the audio would continue on the next videos i would have to close and restart app to get it to stop even if i scroll back and pause the add when i start to scroll the videos the ad audio starts again
basically a stalkers paradise because their block function doesnt exist and only prevents them interacting with you they still see all your content also every imagevideo or post you make is scan totrain ai and its not something you can opt out of use blue sky its got the feeling of twitter i will die before i call it x and none of the toxicity of the app
the integration of ads has become so worse that at this point im seeing more ads than tweets the ads provide awful experience making the app slow and sluggish frame rate is reduced when scrolling cant play the videos properly like whats the point of the app if they gon na show more ads than tweets worst experience after elon taking up this app
with the continous updates the apps is declining alot of crashing videos dont always work and they took away looking at other peoples likes they introduced x premium but it seems pointless their is an option to uncensored nsfw but it literally does not work and you still have to click on the very small box on the right to view the material marked as nsfw also increasing more policy to decrease artist who use the app by using ai to use their art without compensation
my experience has been terrible unending and timeconsuming authentication another bad experience is failure to recognise my pass word even a second after changing a new password it was not like this before do something to rectify these things
its not good anymore the app has this time around pm to like am where it doesnt want to load anything i usually have to use the browser which in some cases is inconvenient hes removing the block functions core components if i do not want to see something i do not want to see it wasnt this app supposed to use algorithms to see what we as the user likes no its just bots and verified accounts spamming random stuff even if i did block them more come around bad app
over the last year or so the app has gotten extremely buggy sometimes pictures posts get stuck in an infinite upload that never goes through drafts no longer save are viewable when you try to get back to them i have an entire person who i cant directly message on the app because clicking on their chat thread crashes the app but i can message other people
updated hoping it would help but for weeks now the app is struggling to load anything from pictures videos and comments everything is just blank its making the app so unusable updating did nothing but make it worse edit nothing has changed its not my home wifi either since i use my phone data since my wifi is slower everything loads on twitter as if im using my home wifi when every other app loads and works the same sucks a ton
as many others have said the app has gone seriously downhill since the change of ownership the newest update is now changing the block feature so that even whenafter you block someone they can still see your content they just cant interact with it which still defeats the purpose of blocking im also pretty positive this goes against terms of service for being available in the play store google you should really look into that
absolutely horrendous since elon took over the app will randomly just not work at all no pages will load or update for an indeterminate amount of time no reset uninstall force stop etc will make it work the amount of ads and bots are unbearable too full blown propaganda and racism littered throughout the tl elon has ruined this once great app
mobile app will just close itself randomly happens most commonly while typing in messages ends up deleting your whole text and kicking you back to the main pagesection from what i can tell theyre still limiting the amount of posts you can view in a day as well this app just keeps going downhill
app loading is horribly inconsistent i need to reopen the app repeatedly to view content sent as push notifications photos and content may go away and become unloadable when going from portrait to landscape and posts may not actually register likesrepliesreposts even if the icons become lit where applicable the loss of many original twitter developers is noticeable there hasnt been any updates of note recently to address this on android so i often give up on trying to connect
ever since elon took over twitter i have not seen a day when this app functions normally the upgrades make it even worse so i usually dont update but it gets to hard to use that updating feels like the only option on previous version i complained about the video freezing with other things like app stops loading when phone charges it started to get so bad that i ended up updating the app and now the app freezes when im typing message the previous version issues arent resolved still lol
i have kept the autopsy video turned off forever but recently it is showing playback error for every video plays when i turn that on and the feed automatically refreshes a lot terrible experience
updates just keep getting worse and infinitely more unhelpful a most recent example of this is them deletingeverysinglesaveddraft everyone had which i often used to jot down ideas and important info on the go update sept i have been able to reliably refresh my feed for a couple months now without it acting like ive got internet connection
i do love it i live on it but good lord for almost a year now the app doesnt work at all every single time i put my phone on charge and it is happening to so many other people and they still havent fixed it feels like a kind of major issue to not have resolved for so long many a cogent tweet has been lost forever cause anything that fails to send while in that state just disappears forever please christ fix this stuff never even mind the rise of verified ai replies farming money
this update still messed up the videos when you watch one you can heard what the other vid is about the audio mix fix it and also you can see one tweet multiply times from one user and title like ad
i updated the app and i cant send tweets the tweet button doesnt work at all edit latest update didnt fix anything i have to download previous versions for the button to work what is the point of the app if i cant tweet or quote tweets
every time i open the app after inital installation it just wont respond i have to reinstall the app every time i want to open it edit the problem seem to have been happening less but in turn it deletes chat histories randomly and hides pinned chats to where i cant unpon them anymore
ever since the app was purchased by the biggest fraud in the world the app has become increasingly hostile unfair and unsafe with the newest update to the block feature essentially removing the function altogether despite claiming otherwise this app is no longer safe for anyone unless a use private the account that isnt an option when you use the app for discoverability
idk what happened when people rates are low fyi dont update the app when there is no bug fix in the description wait for another version update so you will know what is the problem the devs might be fixing edit sometimes the like and bookmark option does not work and saving photos takes decades
elon has actively run this app into the ground almost as if intentional likes are hidden so creeps can be creeps theyre making blocking like everything else a feature for premium forcing you to pay for the same experience youve had for years but still worse awful terrible man awful terrible app
as time has gone by more and more bigotry has been appearing on the app its concerning anyone would encourage thjs on top of that i keep getting ads for scams regularly i just block all accounts that run advertisements as soon as i see them
after the last two disgusting and horrible updates im rating this star just to get it taken off app stores truly a slimy move on their part making ai be able to steal real artists hard work and the block feature being absolutely useless now that people can still view your posts after youve blocked them actually such a horrendous update i dont know why any normal human would actually agree to allow ai to steal their art please rate this star so we can get this app deleted
im giving this app a star because for some unknown reason this is frustrating i cant log into my account and im somehow lock out furthermore when i try x on my pc andor phone both of them giving off a message saying something went wrong but there only a button that say try again after a while about hrs to days i try again still nothing happen i still getting the same message and cant access my account tbh i dont even know how or why this happen
this has been my favorite app for over a decade and to see this decline is really sad cant even use the app anymore nothing loads dms dont work cant see my notifications until it decides it wants to fix itself refresh force close app uninstall and re downloading dont even help hope they fix this soon with a new update asap
new update doesnt let you open pictures in dms app still sucks since elon took over the one thing we use it for is group chats and the chats wont open half the time awful app give us twitter back back to add to the review because the app constantly crashes still
for the last three days app is working insanely bad constant glitches crashes my whole phone slows down i cant scroll i cant see new notifications or messages when i scroll down i reach end and i have to scroll up and down fast to force the app to load new posts below its insanely bad and even after the last update which i did mins ago still working like a dogshit
i like that being informed can come instantly but theres much to be desired and much that could be improved in terms of features the ai is coming along i would like a search engine that would allow me to break away from my reliance on google and i would also like it if x had an app store because it seems google dominates that field as well
this app is horrible after the company was bought out by musk right now its nearly unnavigatable there are so many ads and unnecessary features that reset so many sexbots and right wing propaganda sockpuppets that pop up under recommended even if you block and this includes rage baiting in comment sections report and search feature is severely broken i am considering uninstalling and moving to better social media sites do not bother with this app anymore unless you are a masochist
multiple bad changes while good features are taken away adds privacy feature like hidden likes but you can not block any suspicious accounts from seeing your content which is very creepy and doesnt help my privacy overran by bots
reduced from to because twitter spaces has been added but its the biggest battery drain there is it even drains faster than the phone can charge thats on a samsung galaxy if twitter gets the power issue sorted ill up to because of spaces
problematic new update update the latest update is weirdly slow i know this because when i used other phone which got old twitter with the old logo and name the old one is blazingly fast even though some feature arent usable the new one got new features but weirldy slow even sometimes unusable i asked my friend about it and he more or less agree and even needs restart to fix it
so i recently dled x enjoyed ot for about a week suddenly im locked out told to enter my email i did only to be told my email was being used yeah it is being used by my account this is exactly what twitter did to me i tried to understand what im supposed to do to get it working but i hate computers more than i hate harris im just uninstalling this cause im not going through this nightmare again truth social youtube are good
ai training is now part of the website and you cant turn it off people youve blocked can still see your posts now ads are built into the website so they are everywhere porn is under every post if you use the wrong flagged words oh and right wing propaganda hope this website with a porn letter for its name crashes
very weird app used to be people talking sharing pictures etc now its become a sewer of misinformation and political manipulation legit a platform that talks about the fake new media and being honest free speech while spreading more lies and inaccuracies than any platform available
the best place to be tuned into what is happening in the world as for the app its way better than mobile web and preferable to even web on desktop however recently some bugs have appeared like when i click on followersfollowing they added so many tabs and the lists of names are often not updated despite notifications of followers etc they seem to be developing android more quickly which in the past has lagged behind ios rapid dev is good as long as new bugs arent the result
every or posts is another ad the same ones pop up hundreds of times a day it is impossible to keep up with blockingmuting all the bots that fill the reply sections not to mention the new block feature that emporer musk is rolling out so you can no longer block him from your feed this app was been in steady decline since he took over but this might be the death blow
the platform has improved a lot since twitter era community notes is a breakthrough feature that made x unique it used to combat bad information with better information the most free speech platform in the world right now its a complete pvp server where high ranking player with complete full rank gear can be seen fighting against each other for their belief freedom and happiness
no block or restrict feature means i will not be engaging in this app anymore removing those features actively created an unsafe space i cant see likes of people that havent blocked me but people i block can view my whole page yeah thats redundant no reason to use this app anymore if youre even mildly worried about online safety
nonstop crashes not related to my network everything else works fine so annoyed i am blue checkmark paying for constant freezes swallowing posts having to start over not fun right now fix it
one of the latest updates seem to have really broken the app i keep having my account logged out due to an error after liking tweets and these arent political tweets at all they can be just random tweets about gaming sometimes i encounter a message saying my account has been locked due to suspicious activity i guess following accounts accounts liking tweets is sus nowadays im at the point now where i just wan na say yall can just keep me logged out and ill head over to bluesky
this app is objectively bad its a consistently volatile environment that only gets more harmful as a user and creator i cant stay first the app only promotes negative content i get notifications for interest posts are always negative and tied to drama second content you upload to the site they will claim rights to your face voice creations third the final straw there is no functioning block feature without premium you effectively have no privacy unusable and unsafe
edit twitter does not refresh or load content at all on my pixel a if the phone is charging just to add to how hilariously broken this app is bots spam everywhere images regularly do not load properly and timeline wont refresh to pull in new content even the ads often show up as blank spaces due to a lack of buyers on ad space replies are borderline unusable because of ai spam and bots linking out to malware websites user experience is horrible overall dont bother
cant even login following update no error or anything it just keeps looping back to the new unhelpful main login page clicking the tinyl little login option at the bottom takes you to enter your username or email and then password and as i said just takes you back to the first page again ive tried with both of my accounts that im able to log in to in my browser as if the entire site hasnt tanked since musk now the app keeps getting worse too never imagined id miss twitter
it was my fav social media app but lately have been getting worse much more spam and bots than ever in my mentions and dm is so annoying update app got even worse and now it looks like an adult videos site uodate getting worse by the day now dm messages dont show correctly update the block feature was removed
the best platform for all your viewing needs its up to date with the latest news entertainment science history and much more there are options for everyone best of all absolutely no technical issues with this platform plus its a friendly atmosphere and they dont discriminate everyone is entitled to have their opinion if it were possible i would give x a
new updates have been completely unnecessary instead of working on the different issues almost every user has been experiencing search bar not working videos not playing timeline not loading etc its disappointing seeing how the new owner of this app seems as if his plan was to ruin this app so disappointing
muted words is not working app is auto playing ads with auto play videos disabled this shouldnt be happening and its a waste of my data in addition the app tried to enable my location without me turning it on website continues to go downhill along with the app app somehow obtained permission for nearby devices which is concerning as it shouldnt need this
similarly to other people my app constantly breaks refuses to load and now it has this new bug where it crashes at least times when i try to send a single dm elon needs to sell it to someone who is capable and willing to hire enough people to run it like they used to ive been on twitter for more than a decade and it was never this bad
app fails to refresh or update feed every day multiple times a day no matter how many times i refresh close and reopen etc seems this especially and always happens if my phone is plugged in and charging at the time
elon is our legend you best all appreciate that only thing i still wish for this app would be an edit button i get longer texts and other options for a fee but edits should be free otherwise i prefer this better than the version i last used a few years ago
the app has become an echo chamber for far right individuals it is flooded with tweets and ads in favor of far right agendas the block feature isnt even a block anymore they removed all the features which were helpful in the past
app has been going downhill in terms of features but the worst part is that nothing loads there will be times where posts and videos just refuse to load and buffer for a long time this happens enough where its not that uncommon funny enough ads always load instantly
my drug of choice this platform is an undeniable cesspool compounded with the hostile algorithm unhinged levels of censorship broken video player paywalled basic features and everything getting measurably worse by the day and you have the worst app on the internet if you have yet to be absorbed stay away
twitter has gone downhill dramatically in recent months the app doesnt work at all when your phone is charging it stops loading any content the search function is completely broken your own content no longer updates if you change your username it used to be searchable by your new username after a few days replies on popular tweets used to be fun to scroll through just to see what people had to say now its filled with spam and bots every new feature actively makes the app worse
great app for everything you need but it doesnt work properly sometimes it loads things late and videos dont even play sometime i think theres some bugs in the system that has to be fixed
of the time when i open this app it refuses to load anything i have wifi im right next to the router its updated so idk what the problem is but it needs to be fixed so the app is usable this is ridiculous i cant even hard close the app and restart it it just stays stuck until it decides to work
editing my review from to because of the continuous problems with the app its unable to refresh after the command sometimes just freeze without refreshing videos in the background keep playing even when you move onto other videos and photos these issues havent been resolved in last months despite of like updates
just got a popup on the app itself that the block function will soon be changing if you block a user they will still be able to see your posts but wont be able to interact they will however be able to screenshot and post that image to their about this seems unsafe in many circumstances
twitter platform is not public its monetize so elon can make money x dont paid but is allow to use your data which you must pay for to keep your network connected sign is a scammed the ask for email to sign in then they ask for user account name when you tell x you forgot the user name they still wont send you a a password change to your email why because they need complete access to your account everytime you call them
since the privatization of this platform the flood gates on bots and misinformation are at an alltime high the platform is nearly unusable new users get bombarded by it the moment they sign in it takes forever to muteblock all the accounts the algorithm is prioritizing showing you every so often the algorithm will randomly bypass the learned user preferences and begin the process all over one of the owners pushes it personally on his own account
app routinely fails to propagate the timeline with content i believe i found the source of the infinite loading glitch if you block too many ads on twitter itll sometimes attempt to generate an ad but nothing will show up this typically coincides with the app failing to load any new content i have been unable to access twiter for over an hour this morning even though my internet works on every other website and app because it will not update the timeline with a blank ad showing
very unstable app nowadays the interface is buggy the app lags out when loading new posts into the feed recommendations get clogged up with ads every posts and constantly refreshes the feed i still use it for indie game and pixel art news but i might end up migrating to something called bluesky sorry twitter you will never be missed elon has ruined it for us already
so frustrating been trying to create an account for hours now and always failed in verifying the phone number the verification text deducted money from my account but still wont let me push through no customer service and support email no one will help you if you have problem like this cant submit a support ticket since the account is not yet created so frustrating scammer and will not help you eventhougn you lost your money garbage
elon ruined the app the algorithm is nonsense the ads wont go away when click i dont want to see it the for you page is nonsense and there are too many bots on the app also the new block feature
two accounts same app same phone same wifi different load times one account will literally just stop loadingupdating and begin to stall every single day meanwhile the other account works just fine loads normally no hiccups it is like the website itself just decides when to stop working on specific users entirely for a set amount of time its becoming shady
i paid for x premium plus after a day i got my blue tick the following day the blue tick was removed and every premium plus package i was asked to pay again even though i had just used this for days honestly this is very sad and embarrassing elon musk needs to fix his customer service he has a very poor customer service
it autoplays multiple videos on top of each other constantly its a horrible experience wouldnt recommend anyone use edit thats still not fixed btw but now theyre removing blocks so that bots can attack you easier they really want this app to die it seems
bring back the video loop instead showing series of random videos after watching it its not unique anymore but becoming just like facebook reels no wonder people are moving to the new app
ive been using this app pretty consistently since but it has become completely unusable asks me to sign in every time i open it processes the info and goes right back to the login page wont open until i completely clear my cache crashes every time i try to send a picture in dms or respond to an individual message
started having the signin issues again app it used to do this about months ago now its starting again it will show the box to sign in using google and that just bumps me out then ill sign in using my info and it bumps me out hours later it will be fine it also shows updates available only when i went to leave a review the dumb app was updated tired of this nonsense
what i like most unique approach the x app takes a different approach to social media focusing on communitybuilding and discussion simple interface the apps design is minimalistic and easy to navigate decentralized the x app is built on decentralized technology which could potentially provide more control to users
not even exaggerating this app has so many issues i cant search my own account for things i posted minutes ago a day ago a year ago i know they exist i can quote my own post but i cant see it when i click on the quotes and thats true for any number of quotes i can see but cant view the account timeline is completely dislinear and impossible to follow about of the time i cant even highlight text on the app its bad
dont use it much as not a social media person however i have never had the problems these other reviewers have i use a samsung android and it works fine when following peoples football updates and highlight videos maybe these reviews are from the bluesky bunch
i dont was checking the premium features and i got wrongly billed for basic instead of the premium since then if i click the premium options under settings the app crashes this has been happening for than a month now i tried visiting through the web but they said that i can only cancel or manage my subscription through the mobile app a big app like tweeter still gets messed with this type of bugs
old twitter is finally getting better with x ive noticed nuances in the marketplace large companies are using the grammar of old twitter which is x obviously because its been etched already into our minds begs the question what came before the chicken i still dont know that answer lol clue not the chicken
ever since twitter changed to x it has been decline in quality for some reason when i charge my phone the app stops working now theres a bunch of bots commenting following and liking blocking someone still allows them to see your account wich defeats the purpose of blocking them theres no bright future of this app only a worse one as it keeps adding and removing things
i need to unlock my account so it can go public and i can not seem to get any help no one is seeing my posts still waiting for help on my x account i have attempted five times to get tech support to help me with to merge two accounts that was months ago im still waiting im sick of this im going to other websites at least they may have tech support its been five months still no response still waiting
i love the idea of free speech but this recent update makes this app extremely annoying to use watch a video and immediately after an ad pops up mostly temu which i will never ever use but when you try to click back it opens the play store trying to give you the temu app when app ads get this annoying i stop using them
the help page says the limit for following people in a day is i followed and it wont let me follow any more i am blocked from posting without being in trouble just some arbitrary limit that i cant even see to know when ive hit it and they do indeed still censor just not as much as the other ones elons a liar the app is useless and censorious unless youre famous and you have to pay for better treatment
happy with the premium options user interface is simple and smooth and the algorithm is generally useful could reach five stars with better bot management and more effective control of explicit content or at least more robust user filter options
paid for premium and a couple months in of my comments are behind a wall contacted support via the link in my profile and got a message saying thanks for contacting support well get back to you here in a couple days really its been days and they still havent responded but yall can harass users with popups about the block feature being revamped though
this app gets worse worse since elon bought it artists are now forced to accept that their art can be used to teach ai its no longer optional the new terms of service also say that they can profit from an artists work with no credit or permission needed regardless of how they choose to use it i miss the old twitter
this app is crashing after every seconds tried everything from uninstalling and reinstalling the app to restarting the cell phone but nothing works it keeps on crashing x team needs to fix it asap
when i plug my phone in the app loses its connection to the servers im still connected to the internet other apps that require a connection still work fine its literally just this one edit this app being open kills every other app running at some point i will be listening to music on spotify for instance and if i spend long enough on this app the music will stop because it killed the spotify process
app keeps crashing every time i try to send a dm it keeps crashing only to certain people though theres no support whatsoever i try to go on to the settings to find support even sent an email and nothing this app has gone downhill since you know who took over
the video adds keep pausing whatever is playing on my phone i dont even click on them they just appear on the timeline and pause my stuff makes the app nearly unusable
the gore and death is stupid now i have my settings set to hide deathgore and im still witnessing the final moments of people on this app its extremely draining mentally to keep seeing this ads are extremely low quality now with most just being straight up scams and shown after every post bot problem has gotten so much worse too if you value your mental health uninstall this app
notifications dont even show up on my phone and has periods where the timeline doesnt refresh and i cant send or receive messages also this app is rampant with racists in plain view and if you try to report them they will say the user did not violate any safety policies dont waste your time joining
inappropriate ads every few posts that dont go away no matter how many times you press i dont like this ad tons of bots and people being able to still creep on you after being blocked makes this one of the worst social apps it was so much better when it was simply twitter and not x
the x website is now working on my computer and it seems it wanted me to enter my phone number as the username somehow i couldnt recognize my login info so i think i figured it out what i was doing wrong with the website now i have to remember my phone number is the login info but this app is very good i like how i can follow people who play the games that i have
this app has been horrible for almost a year now android cant even use this app while its charging it literally wont refresh not to mention i can not refresh my own likes post or replies in chronological order i literally can not find my own tweet from days ago by scrolling my own post or replies this problem has persisted for android for at least months if not more no update redownload cache nor data cleaning has fixed it fix this trash app or let us download rd party apps
this app has just kept on falling off a cliff ever since elon took over more bots ads before seeing a post while trying to scroll through this ad the app starts to lagging and the ads keep on jumping up to the next ad and doesnt want to scroll pass them keep on getting the video playback error even on a stable internet connection with an updated app
x is the dumbest name it looks so stupid edit the app matches the name now worse than twitter in every conceivable way repeating algorithm scam ads so many bots many with verified icon no true blocking its awful
where do i even begin app randomly refreshes i have to click times on the play button for a video to start playing i see irrelevant posts most of the time on my tl rather than stuff i actually want to see if there is a popular post its overridden with bots in the replies i barely see posts in the quotes if the purpose of making the without subscription version downright unusable is to herd people to start paying then i would say the intent is sorely losing
twitter updates are slownonexistent on android ios users have the ability to stop autoscrolling videos and get more frequent updates current version of app on android s ultra often freezes refuses to load content regardless of sufficient internet connection and lacks quality of life features i am only able to change my pfp through the browser because the app doesnt work audio will randomly start playing from videos not on the screen app makes me want to quit using social media
block button does not work effectively still allowing those who you do not want viewing your content to view it this become incredibly dangerous for those who are trying to hide their content from a stalker or somebody with negative intentions also the reply section has become unusable with the sheer amount of bots who pay for blue checkmarks to get priority generative ai is pushed onto the user and violent and sexual content is often uncensored this is not a safe app
doesnt function at all no matter how many times i restart it like closing it doesnt really close it decides on its own when it will work again better off just running twitter in your favorite browser app instead
i like how it brought benefits to people working with the app but for regular users its been a mess the block functionality the verification status that used to be great to pick apart official and unofficial sources not to mention the huge increase of bots i wish these would be addressed no need to fix whats not broken
ads bugs and bots elon is supposed to be a genius but has made this app borderline unusable ads between posts constant playback issues on videos none on the autoplay ads strangely more bots than ever all being linked to r sites and thats before the alogarithm that forces you to view racist bile edit in app messaging service has also broken
the block feature no longer blocks users from watching reading or screenshotting the content of those who have them blocked it only blocks them from engaging with it commenting liking reposting this is not a functional block feature as required for x to be listed in the app store or as required for x to be functional in certain countries this change to the block feature will enable harassment and abuse and violates user privacy
not only the app enabling more porns under elon musk but it also shifted to become meh marketing site with repetitive ad of same apps even facebook instagram ads are better not repetitive really capture your attention to look at the ads not scrolling it away
with the newest grok update designed to steal and use all content on the app without user consent its time to say goodbye to this fetid cancerous inceldriven excuse of an app ever since it was bought out by dusty musky its been driven into the ground and driven away users and developers alike with intense amounts of hate speech incentivized violence and baldfaced misinformation the internet mourns the loss of this longstanding fountain of human interaction everyone press f
so many ads now i get the same mobile game ad on my feed times in a row i can say i dont like the ad but it makes no difference those same ads keep on coming maybe after the th ad ill give in and download
whenever i open x twitter it autorefreshes by itself this feature is very frustrating as its worsening my user experience day by day and its also very irritating please fix this as soon as possible
the new block feature sucks opens the door to stalking the platform has also become a far right echochamber and its honestly disgusting with the updates to the block feature it directly violates google plays terms of service awful app the bird was far superior in every way full of bots and trash stars if possible
my x keeps crashing whenever im messaging it opens the keyboard very slowly and i have been trying everything my phone told me to put it in deep sleep i did but its just so annoying having to do so much work just to enter an app i would just like for it to not crash anylonger please and thank you
horrible horrible site that has turned into nothing more than an unfiltered hatefest of misinformation and lieing free speech and truth my arse ads on top of ads and lots of very questionable and often disturbing content twitter was never meant to end up a musktrump right wing lovein bsky a times better
gets worse with every update every new feature or change makes it less desirable and more frustrating and unenjoyable for users absolutely overrun with ads videos no longer loop they now skip to an ad and recently announced changes to blocking accounts mean it will be unsafe to use musk took a perfectly fine social media site and destroyed every single thing that was good about it
the app keeps crashing for no reason there are great things to read on the app but difficult and time consuming with the crashing please fix the issues
recently it has became garbage i have premium subscription and i receive notification from people i dont even follow or have any link with whats the point its my work account even my notification settings are fine
app works sometimes other times it just hangs and doesnt load and it just fixes itself whenever it wants super frustrating to deal with edit this still happens at times its not fixed plus now i feel the app is slow and likes to load lots of ads that auto play
its a good app but its hard to find stuff i had a small problem and it took me a lot of effort to find the way to open the ticket with tech support that was annoying they have lots of frequently asked questions but theyre limited buckets and if you dont have an answer to what youre looking for getting in contact of a help is difficult thats my experience so far
twitter is an essential platform for bts army offering realtime updates direct interactions with members and a supportive global community hashtags bring fans together and fanled projects flourish here however it also has drawbacks like fan wars misinformation and spam accounts which can sometimes make the experience overwhelming overall twitter is invaluable for staying connected as long as you approach it with a focus on positivity and balance
love the app but im tired of it locking up or losing connection where nothing loads for minutes its annoying i know its not my service everything else works
the user friendly experience is impressive the app is a one stop news space for me i get whats happening within my environment as quick as possible this is because people has seen that x is a fast space to tell the world the real story finally i will suggest that x management look into filtering fake news the more even as theyve started so that people wont be deceived so far from my user experience i will give x app stars
i got this really unappropriate ads when i clicked the dislike ads button the specific ads did not disappear and always pop up again and again hope it get fixed asap cause it is really annoying ads getting broken again ugh why is it not personalized
lets just ignore everything that has happened to x cause that would result in stars if possible but rn it is just a complete mess performance wise crashes freezes random closes of the app i cant send dms properly anymore reinstalled a couple times cleared the cache have the lastest version nothing helps
worse app even their contact support is also worst since last days i am trying to sign in to my account but i lost my two factor authentication app so i didnt getting code to enter from that day contact support is saying that we will mail you to regain your account but still i didnt receive any mail
after reading dozens of the and star reviews its fairly obvious that there is a coordinated effort to hurt the platform the wording repeated throughout the reviews makes it clear i have had no issues with crashing or freezing the functionality is the same as it has always been
my data was too low so i turned data saver mode so that i can save my data but why theses advertisements are playing automatically and consumes more data what is use of data saver mode please fix this issue in next update
have been the worst since the last update the app doesnt open so i had to uninstall and reinstall but then again its the same thing i have to repeat after few days even if the app does open it takes way too long to refresh the feed and keeps glitching inbetween really troublesome
ive used this for ages ill probably continue to use it out of various social necessities elon musks creative direction however has run the app into the ground basic usability is tanking spam is worse than ever most of it prompted in blue tick posts harassment and hate speech are getting worse with moderation seemingly nonexistent no wonder advertisers are avoiding it like the plague
x twitter is awesome its very much a free speech platform now and it allows for open dialogue its for you page is actually for me its trusted and they have cool community note features that fact check people but i dont like that community notes sometimes dont let the satirical and posts that are joking just be there always has to be a reality community note so thats why i gave this app thank god for elon musk though
the app has become increasingly unusable in the last two months its a stream of ads and people im not interested in seeing engagement has been notably on the decline for our business accounts making it less valuable from a promotional perspective
developer contact email here is invalid changed to stars recent changes playing a video in a tweet now instead of repeating plays the next video on the account but pretty frequently jumps to another account completely even ones im not following and starts playing their videos sometimes it returns to the proper account or some other account that i am following update continuous video play behavior often switches to adult content happened to my kid the other day needs fixing asap
been with twitter since the early s and had to leave recently due to just how poorly it functions as an app the ads are relentless which makes it impossible to tell whats a genuine post it feels like every day this app degrades more and more since new management took over the severely unfun and honestly hateful community that has come to use this app are too loud to ignore
please fix the bug the app is currently unusable and closes itself out giving me a pop up saying to wait for the bug to be fixed then update the app it has been days now and the bug still hasnt been fixed i dont want to uninstall it reinstall it and try to log back into the app again all because the app hasnt been fixed now in days fix it
ads report is useless how many time i reported an ad exact ad still coming out at least change the ads and how can you put an ad on an ad or promoted post with video ads combo but if i reported the ads which ads you will check ads post every user post in timeline i wonder why my timeline is full of ads i miss the old twitter
complete junk always glitchy always lags constantly refreshes the feed on its own when you tell it you dont want to see tweets from certain account they still keep showing up
currently my x app very slowww cant even load photoss or videooonly can read whyyy i loveee x app butttt its veryy sloww right nowbut if i using wifi its totally fineit happen when using mobile dataonly this app is problem because my internet was not slow for other apps
please improve the log in system when i enter my email it ask for user than says doesnt match no easy way to find out which email was clubbed with which user id because of this i am out of twitter for past month soo lame other platforms has better options when it comes to login and forgot password
this app is ridiculously bad it doesnt keep your place if you click on show more tweets you have to scroll down to the place you remembered and then repeat if you want more lists are annoying to access it has gone from me scrolling through hundreds and hundreds of tweets a day to looking at and using alternatives like discord oh and twitter spaces more tweets take up a bunch of window for you is useless beyond frustratingif only there was a rating images regularly fail to load
i hope this will finds you well this was the worse developed and having more than one bug and running playback errors while playing it has special feature like it can play more than one audio at a time for a single vedio
i dunno doesnt seem to work well on my device links are constantly dead if i open them from any other app constantly get posts from people i dont follow quite a few crashes
a video keeps playing even though i already scrolled or went to a different page causing an overlap on sounds whenever i play another video id have to go backscroll back just to mute the first video its annoying
im getting problems with this app such as watching an article and the audio continues over again and again until i have to restart my phone i literally have to restart the phone to stop that article because it wont stop even if i leave the app how do i fix this ive now lost my account i believe ive been hacked through x and theyve used another email account of mine which i did not allow come on x why is it so hard to get help
multiple audio play at the same time while watching a video another audio plays in the backgroundday by day its becoming worst this is what happens when you assign the work of people to
despite the overall toxicity of the whole app with violent algorithms chld prn self h compete nudity etc and the terrible person who controls it its completely full of bots and ai like its gotten so bad that over percent of the following on small accounts are bots and prn actors and theyre not trying to do anything theres no filter with the disgusting content on here and again no ones doing anything screw this app
the app was purchased in a hostile takeover and now the new owner is denying me my right to block people recording my conversations for ai training data and paywalling features i used to use for free it crashes constantly it gives constant error messages even when nothing is happening videos on my tl frequently play simultaneously with overlapping audio the search engine no longer works and i can no longer find old tweets even when searching their content verbatim
a cesspool of rightwing extremism and bot spam the feed keeps autorefreshing block function has become useless the algorithm has ruined all user engagement notifications are barely working your posts are used for ai datascraping that you can not opt out of all wrapped into the worst rebrand ever elon took a well functioning app and destroyed it just to feed his own baby ego
unbiased town square with community notes if you want the truth come to twitter mainstream media have lost all credibility and cant be trusted the new news source is here edit saw other negative reviews and cant help but feel they may be politically motivated the app has never been better grok is amazing videos play seamlessly and everything works fine for me
finally unbanned still isnt showing things in chronological order which is terrible got permanently muted and im not sure how or why it has a lot of people on it used to be almost decent for news however recent updates make trying to follow a story as it develops impossible
best social media site but worst application ever the website works fine but the app sometimes just doesnt respond the home feed doesnt refreshand gets stuck on the same posts from last refreshing of the feed just pathetic it is gets really frustrating when you wan na scroll twitter but can not and we cant even post anything or like anything at that specific time when the app crashes
borderline unusual since elon took over timeline wont refresh half the time replies almost never load videos freeze when i click to view so many bots pushed into view because they pay for verification
excellent app i have read other android users having playback issues etc i have not experienced any of those issues a regular theme i find fairly constantly is since change of ownership the requirements to restart app videos will not play i disagree i have not experienced any of these issues i dont recall anyone reaching out to x seeking solutions i imagine that this doesnt occur because there are no issues thank you x for an awesome and true platform other than truth soc
my timeline keeps freezing for several months i cant retrieve new updates on dm and the timeline always crashes cleared catches and still not worked used website instead please fix update the new version update months apart still the same always crash freeze lackslow plus they updated block featurephotos consent
good app search could be better news needs a bit more organization this is one of the very few apps for which i pay so my experience may differ from yours i am a smaller account its pretty hard to get noticed my engagement on x is not very good possibly due to a couple facts i was part of the great conservative throttling because i openly discussed the stealing of the election and my engagement may be reduced based on some unknown algorithm or maybe im just unpopular
there was an update a few months back that autoplays an ad or the next video when the video you initially selected has looped once or twice its made engagement and enjoyment of the initial content miserable and there is no way to disable the feature
using x is now frustrating the app keeps logging out of my account anytime i open it or it keeps saying i should authenticate every time the worst thing now is i cant get access to my account and i have contacted their support team countless times but the problem is not being resolved frustrating do better x
the content on the app has changed for the worse accounts you follow no longer have prominence in your timeline feed because the algorithm strongly promotes a particular political view over everything else there does not appear to be an effective moderation team and for a platform whos terms allow year olds to sign up for an account there is a lot of adult content being posted
as much as i love twitter i refuse to call it x with the recent updates it has come with lots of bugs which cause it to have trouble reloading pages and then once it does that it doesnt want to load at all even if you completely shut the app down and reopen it i havent found a way to resolve this yet either other than just waiting it out which can take hours sometimes
using a group chat function is a nightmare the app keeps crashing often multiple times for the same message and often times it refuses to send the message at all by softlocking the screen its mighty pathetic that i have to use the browser version on my phone
twittersupport hello im experiencing issues with my twitter account and need assistance getting it resolved my account isnt functioning properly briefly explain your specific issue here like login problems verification issues or account suspension if applicable and ive tried all the troubleshooting steps suggested can you please review my account and help me resolve this id appreciate any support you can provide to get me back online smoothly thank you
very bad experience i have to go under a verification every day while using sudden its log out automatically then the same thing verify its you or something puzzle types games sometimes it can not load news feed very poor app when using it feels like that im using a webpage
made a twitter account years ago went to recover the old account found b impossible made new account w phone had a bunch of trumprepublican stuff crammed in my face as my possible interests and was forced to select one before continuing they threw one option for following a democrat and that was biden even though he wasnt running probably to look unbiased was shortly thereafter locked out with no means to recover my original account info it runs u in a useless circle if u try
audio from videos keeps playing in background even after leaving that piece of content i cant stand it sometimes even after closing the app wth
twitter x is a fantastic platform for staying informed and connected in real time with its blend of news trending topics and engaging conversations its perfect for following interests discovering new voices and joining communities the app is userfriendly and recent updates have made it even smoother to use whether youre into news entertainment or networking x has something for everyone
why im being asked for username as part of verification not login and password ffs how stupid where i suppose to find this if account was created using google sing in completely locked for not opening the app for weeks this is ridiculous forces contacts sharing and access at registration with no option to refuse and so buggy its unusable
the most recent update has removed the blocking feature entirely allowing for stalking harassment and other unwanted behaviors to occur when you block someone they should not be able to see your posts after the block this is a direct violation of googles and apples policies on social media apps and their block function
update still disappearing dmsthey disappear as if you swiped to the right yourself very aggravating to say the least dm is garbagegetting to be unusable type your replyit disappears no matter what language you use or whatever you have to say it disappears no other apps give me this problem along with other problems in ratingsx x isnt ready for android op systems imo
x talks about free speech unless its something they dont like and then you get put on limited view and youre not allowed to cancel your blue so you pay for not being able to use your account without the option to cancel
the app has been in a downward spiral for a while the most recent update is very concerning to me as blocking accounts will no longer be truly blocked like other apps apparently those accounts that you have blocked will now me able to see your account but cant interact with you thats not how blocking works my sense of privacy is disappearing
i lost access to my old email account and theres no way to fix that fing google at any rate as a result i can no longer log into twitter twitter refuses to help edit i have regained access to my gmail account and twitter but im leaving the because elon musk destroyed this app
ever since the rebrand to x my overall experience on this app has been getting progressively worse with the upcoming changes to the block function and mandatory ai training with the users posts i could never recommend anyone to use this platform the app also tends to be a bit glitchy do better
love the app hate the following lag sometimes replies dont load lists dont refresh videos dont play search results dont appear and then i have to switch to x web and it works find there id have rated due to these frequent issues but rated because the app helps me find a lot of information
still unable to get a premium membership because i bought a yearly basic plan realized the mistake immediately and was refunded but cant actually pay for premium unless i create a sock puppet account which i wont do that coupled with the many other bugs makes me not recommend it anymore
idk what happened with this app i just want to sign in or anything for creating new account i used all of my gmail and all of em cant be use i try to log in anthr acc but this app always say i frgt passwrd fine then i click frgt passwrd i went to x help and then what this app say it always say i use wrong gmail like why am i always wrong even i actually use the right gmail n passwrd dmn it what is wrong with you i even make new gmail to sign in but what its still not working
from my personal experience from this whole app itself and what i would rather choose from having the freedom to say anything or having to be really stricted on my posts i would rather be stricted every single thing on my feed is just ragebait the old twitter was so much better well not that much better but with fewer posts about any kind of rage bait not to mention misinformation limtied on words
app wont refresh very rarely you see accounts that you follow as for reels only seem to see violence and all similar to s ive blocked x is the last sting of a dying wasp
ever since musk took over theres been an inflation of bots ppl buying their way with bluechecks no moderation and the algorithm is completely abysmal then theres the fa a basic security feature that was removed and is now under a paywall just save your time uninstall this app and head over to bluesky where there is moderation security features and ppl cant buy their way in for their posts to be seen
there are these horrible suggested content notifications that cant be stopped its all sexnudity content that i cant get rid of even after switching off trends and suggestions based on location i never once liked or followed such content and i keep blocking them there is no way to report errors on x i just want to receive suggestions or notifications based on who i followwhat content i like but i never get these please fix this very big inconvenience using oneui on galaxy fold
twitter used to be a good platform to post stuff and chatting with people but now its an awful place i wouldnt recommend for all sort of artistscreator because of x new changes to their policies like blocking accounts any image audio etc will be royaltyfree assets and other stuff
app doesnt load videos keep playing even after the app is closed previous video wont stop playing app doesnt perform normally and would suddenly stop refreshing
ive used this app for decades and in the last years its the worst that its ever been this pos barely works videos barely play or pause frequently just trying to watch them the timeline is flooded with hate speech and racism im constantly bombarded with political ads that have racial undertones the app barely even works i open it and nothing loads so im frequently closing and reopening it im so very disappointed with how much of a failure this has become
horrible corporate greed i open the app and get slammed in the face with a ads to legit post these ads are nothing im interested in and when you block them the ads still remains for stuff i dont want to see or care about or support moral standings the app has gone to the wasteland and is now the boomer app for fascist to lash out on people unchecked joke of what the company was before the horrible ignorant buy out and corporate fixation and greedy monopolizion dont waste your time
i like the app in general for my usage but x constantly barrages me with everything imaginable when it comes to politics this is a space that i would like to come to and get away from that im engulfed with that everywhere else i would love to have a space where i choose the things im interested in x crams the politics down your throat whether you follow certain people or not it gets very overwhelming at times i just want a break sometimes
this app is being so difficult and annoying for no reason i am trying to log in and i put in my saved password so i know its not wrong because its saved yet it says its wrong and i tried to make a new account and for some reason it says something isnt right please try again later everytime i try with a different email please fix your app
i frequently have my headphones connected to devices at once and if i open x while listening to audio on another device it will pause the audio on the other device it is the only app which does this i can not continue the audio on the other device unless i close x please look into a fix
latest update is as expected yet more lowquality ai slop forced onto your screen i am now getting nfl updates despite not living in the us ads are annoying scams but moderation is essentially nonexistent videos constantly autoplay and can not be turned off the boosting of people who pay for the service means the opinions of dullards are constantly forced in your face this is acceptable for the owner who himself is not bright but for most people its annoying im moving to bluer skies
its so bad horrible since the takeover this app has quickly slid into radical right wing territory people saying cis get reported while people saying actual slurs or even have them in usernames have the reports untouched lets not forget block being removed and not being able to opt out of posts being used to train ai also tired of embedded ads that auto play and blast sound and basic features being premium only horrible app dont download dont use it
you really need to fix the autocorrect system i often get in fights with the autocorrect when i clearly spell names or words correct but it autocorrects to something completely different also sex bots are a problem
the ads on x are getting worse and worse first there are more ads today okay i dont have a much problem with this but at least put more space between ads not just tweets second and this is whats make x worse whats the point of autoplay setting to do if it only apply to tweets they should apply that to video ads too video ads are making the app more slower than before and devs need to address that immediately
app is in really bad shape constant frozen states where nothing loads or refreshes if i go to my profile all of the posts are extremely out of order theres been multiple updates recently and not a single of these things has been fixed are you guys even trying or just not paying attention to feedback
despite including the see less often option i now see constant ads to join the premium subscription more than ever before truly the most frustrating app on this store theyve now well and truly destroyed the for you trending page only consists of rage baiting headlines from obscure outlets
had a twitter account for years after the switch in ownership it got hacked and they didnt attempt to rectify it or offer any assistance for a while i didnt bother with a review but i have decided to air my grievance well ahead of festivus
incredible app edit it stops being incredible the app constantly logs me out the video player doesnt work well and crashes much too often when i use it i primarily use twitterx on browser now
elon musk ruined this app with all of his stupid changes blue checkmarks flood replies with inane garbage many simply opting to very plainly have ais craft replies for the sake of earning money there is no end to bot follows and interactions circles one of the best features was cut the block function was gutted nazis run unchecked this app is a complete dumpster fire
nothing but a cesspool of right wing conspiracies and hate i really enjoyed it for up to date sports information and news but there is too much other content elon is pushing that ruined the experience ive been happy with threads and most recently bluesky as the accounts ive been following have been also posting elsewhere too
dont waste your time ive never liked twitter overtime the updates for it have gotten worse there has been an annoying amount of bot accounts and then someone had to come along and ruin it for everyone recently they have gone and made the worst possible desicion removing ability to block peoplewhich was the dumbest decision that anyone could make so many users have no choice but to private thier accounts
its been so bad lately awful new image taking away circles racism and hate speech everywhere and now you cant block people anymore not even mentioning the amount of times the app bugs andor crash out of nowhere or when you try to see the quotes of a tweet ads and bots everywhere just terrible
the app is absolutely annoying it randomly bricks and feeds wont load for more than an hour if you havent used it for some hours it takes way too long to load i hate the app so much
two videos will get played simultaneously sometimes a video will be running in the background even when im watching another video on the full screen player i thought it was a bug thatll get fixed in a while but seems like no one has noticed it ot tried to fix it
this app is very weird before it was called x things were running quite fast and smooth i recall having it on my blackberry and other droids now whenever i open it it only works for just one minute then it gets too sluggish opening notifications feels like a strain on the app another off factor is the amount of ads im bombarded with that are not in my field of interest
the only reason this app is still alive is bc of the userbase literally theres no way an app with only words and pictures take so unbelievably long to load videos only load whenever they want and in the lowest quality possible bots plague the app they feel like an infestation of cockroaches if we make the checkmark a paid subscription there will be less bots only a monkey would think so oh wait
i wish there would be an option of stars iam trying to make an account just bcz of a particular information which is not available on other platforms and it keeps saying try requesting later i wouldnt have bothered to install this app if i could find it on other platforms
the new block feature is a crime its so sick that when we block someone because they make us uncomfortable and the app still allows them to see our personal so whats the point of having block as a feature anyway bring back twitter everyone hate these new updates
keeps on saying messages unable to load on wifi and regular data for android its been over a year of this happening sometimes it wont load for a full day the app is useless
massive improvement over twitter overall i would like it to be better at searching for lists it would be so much better if when i choose a location to explore i see what is trending in those locations and nothing more it used to be like that and it was better that way
ehh still has very questionable changes the brand name is still questionable however upcoming changes are gon na be worse one of these changes is having the people you block being able to see your posts thats not good then theres this thing about grok being trained by your posts possibly without your consent this is driving me off the app more and more if youre looking for an alternative id recommend bluesky
i would give it a zero star rating if possible it has become a toxic environment since the new owner took over too much disinformation even from him although i blocked him and the orange monster its just not a healthy place bluesky is where all my friends are migrating see you there
unable to complete request ive been trying to sign in for days now every single time ive tried i get the message unable to complete request this started happening directly after i tried to delete my account i guess you cant lose anyone users if you refuse to let them leave
the only thing that works good on this app are the bugs app causes phone to over heat using video or audio streaming this app is a battery killer frequently crashes the phone do not use this app on your dayly phone this is one of the worst apps on android i have ever used if this app doesnt improve i will recommend google remove it from google play
app is suddenly draining battery very fast even with very light usage if this continues i will need to uninstall im sure the ridiculous amount of ads from certain companies that i have no interest in and can not be switched off is not helping
this low rating is not because it has a bad user experience overally but because of the hurdles placed for zimbabwean based users to monetize the platform or even make a subscription we cant access stripe neither can we use paypal to makereceive payments on the platform this segregation hurts more than you can imagine and personally im hurt at the lack of support though they may be internal challenges to bring support to zim i hope this changes thank you for this amazing product x team
does not let me sign in something isnt right try your request later it says after i clear the fa stage last time updating the app helped now the latest version doesnt work what a buggy piece of
app no longer uploads videos at p quality since release even if the format is correct and the exact same file uploaded at p in version they are now displayed at p resolution max so the only interface that allows you to tag someone in a video now doesnt allow you to upload it at standard hd resolution and even that is below the p twitter used to support as of release only the first video you attach to a post will be p those after will be p
its a good app until an update a while back when i realized you can not set your feed to be shown in chronological order you used to be able to have that option they dont have that option anymore that needs to be fixed asap i dont like reading my feed by people that i follow that are more than a day old i like my information current and updated fix that signed a premium user
it is a good app but the amount of misinformation could be compared to searching gold in a mountain but if you keep looking around and verifying the information you are gon na be able to find truth and once that happens then it starts to be easy because those that like truth also share others that do the same
this app has become unusable my dms stopped showing any sent or received messages the replies are all bots or ads now with the recent block removal update i have had to set my account to private moderation and safety on the developer end has become nonexistent and user end blocking is frequently the only thing stopping a flood of violent threats and hateful posts
i have been trying to login into my account for so many months now it always says my account was suspended for no proper reason when my account was shifted from twitter to x it changed its name to brad and some last name i noticed this and tried to change it so many times but it rejected saying that my account was suspended due to impersonation issues saying i was pretending to be another person i also sent n number of mails to them requesting deactivation of the account no use
the app repeatedly freezes while refreshing daily and just stops working for an hour or so even restarting the device doesnt work ads are nonstop now sometimes ads in a row the app is garbage now
genuinely terrible half the times i opem it the app wont refresh despite perfectly fine connection to internet literally every other app that requires internet loads completely fine with zero issue wont display videos or load images obviously full of absolute degenrate people but the fact i can barely use it just really hits the bullseye for me
the way this app is managed is abhorrent blocks are being changed so that the person blocked can still see your posts the app is full of ai and posts are being used to train ai there are so many bots and replies to popular posts are usually filled with adult material and gore to name but a few issues the only reason i use this app is because ive used twitter for almost a decade its a habit id love to break because using this app and going through my feed makes me feel sick at times
misinformation and hate speech run rampant because of no moderation ton of bot accounts added useless or just garbage features like the new premium model and that you can no longer see anyones likes somehow the for you page algorithm is even more broken than before i cant fathom how elon managed to make already quite garbage app so much more garbage
the apps comment sections are littered with bots and onlyfansporn advertisements everywhere you go no matter how popular the tweet is bot tweet after bot tweet its insufferable also for some reason the app refuses to load whenever i enter it on random occasions my internet and phone is working completely fine yet the loading circle will continue to spin for minutes before the tweets are loaded in fix this
videos function only sometimes works and often cause background apps to play media also auto playing the next video in queue usually an obnoxious loud ad is the most annoying change ive ever seen in an app
worst video playback system for a social media out there the videos are not loading and gets interrupted or goes into buffering even if youre using high speed network
love to see art on here but the app constantly lags for me and rarely loads will just randomly stop refreshing allowing me to make posts or see anything really annoying considering the app is fully updated and i have a newer gen smart phone works decently for me in browser but its not as convenient as if i were able to just use the app
this app is in clear violation of the google play policy for social media the block feature has been completely removed while keeping the button to appear as if the feature is still available this makes it possible for stalkers to access their victims posts and interact with them
horrible dont know why it randomly doesnt connect to the wifiinternet wont refresh for hours no matter what i do also goes black fix it
this app in its current form is very frustrating im specifically talking about not having any control over who posts to my feed i would like to have control via a to z categories that allow me to pick particular high follower users from those categories to post on my feed im not interested in every tom dick and harrys opinion posting to my feed for those users that do maybe allow for that option as well
a single letter for an app is a nightmare it takes me a while to find the app since after not using it a while the search function wont show the correct app without at least letters
i liked twitter before but elon musk has changed it to the point that i cant enjoy the app anymore there is so much negativity now so much far right politics and so many weird reposts of blatant lies its reached the point where the app is no longer useful to me have deleted my account goodbye twitter aka x
a pathetic fall from grace more ads than posts and posts from blue check accounts are being prioritized so much that even the accounts i follow are being drowned out i didnt see a single post i enjoyed for minutes of scrolling nonstop only posts baiting for engagement and promotions update i cant believe this awful site is still declining in quality but this is my final straw elon removed the block feature this is dangerous reckless and against google play terms of service
i love twitter now with elon at the helm had instagram which daily i had to force quit bc it turned on magically and drained my battery twitters platform is easy to use can see more of post without going into the post easy to bookmark and find over million people get their news here since we cant trust the reg news i love the coverage during the election the planet vibrational frequency raised us into a new paradigm shift
majority of the time refuses to load anything just shows the last few things loaded and never refreshes to show anything new the app has been like this for years the low score reviews have been saying this for just as long how has this not been fixed now the app constantly crashes
i dont like the recent changes to searchfor you and searchnews it is now more difficult to find what i want it also resets titles to top after i read a thread
ive downloaded twitter for the nd time because i already had an account on twitter but it was not working well even by having a good internet nothing was showing off on the screen and now that i have downloaded it again after uninstalling its still not working i am trying to make a new account and error is being shown everytime and even after logging it with the existing account its not working please fix this asap
recent changes to comment sorting and the block button means that the top to replies on every post on my feed is nazi talking points and stale ai reposts of the same comments and i cant even block these people and get their garbage off the page culture is sliding down a toilet if it wasnt there already and every technical change is steps in the wrong direction
wanted to download my data archive need to send sms code to my phone number for authentication when i clicked on send coffee it says cant send sms because the operator is not supported then wanted to update phone number after entering the full number it says please check your internet connection the wifi network is full switched it off the operators network is full and switched elon musk what the hell did you do with twitter
service quality continues to deliberately knowingly decline to what end i do not know social features such as like viewing have been removed for no reason security features such as blocking are effectively redundant i strongly urge people to find an alternative before more dangerous defects are added bluesky appears to be a strong contender true rating
this new feature where you now have to see everyone thats blocked you is getting extremely annoying literally what is the point of forcing me to see something i cant interact with what happened to just being blockedblocking and not seeing any trace of that persons existence
ever since this all was renamed x everything is just going horrible wrong worst of all are those spam replies from bots with blue checkmarks beconing the first things you see and its merely for engagement and not at all related that new name and logo are also very ugly bring back twitter
great app but need to fix system bugs in spaces as its not always stable and when my screen get locked the running space will stop for a while which require me to unlock my phone screen to resume listening and so on
its absolutely terrible dont come here unless absolutely necessary the block feature was fundamentally changed how its still on the app store is beyond me
constantly crashing and not updating my timeline user experience is horrible and very frustrating of the time this app is no longer working could someone be sabotaging it since it became x nothing works on this platform this is a typical xample of how to turn a perfectly working app into trash
ive used this platform since and when it became x last year is when it turned horrible the app is filled with bots nearly every post you look under theres engagement farming bots my whole follower request list has just became bots the reporting system is terrible none of the actual harmful accounts and posts get taken down and somehow youll get a warning or get muted from posting over content that isnt even harmful save your time save your mental health just delete the app
randomly crashes and restarts with no warning this app was just fine before elon took over and changed everything for the worst not to mention since he took over all the fun bot accounts like frogsdaily and stuff like that got taken down but the scam and spam bots are more rampant than ever he should be fired and someone who knows what theyre doing should take over
its a very helpful app similar to facebook to get messages out i understand some people are having problems with the app not responding properly my guess is one of the better ways of doing and getting things to work better is to restart your phone its a computer and for everything to get put back into place in a computer you have to restart it frequently depending on how much you use it within the apps etc
elon is really driving this app into the hole and also trying to use a loophole to make blocking virtually useless is their most recent venture update the horrible block changed have gone live making it so that people you block can still see your posts and profile stalkers rejoice dont download this app if you are new
excellent app good source of news views people need more space for their expressions so the space provided for writing text for including audio video media needs to be increased add a function to enable edit for any alterationcorrection by the author blue badge for authentication of accounts must be restored obviously taking the whole legitimate procedure in consideration
sometimes the app wont work in general a lot of bot accounts cant even check qrts lately and it keeps suggesting me to follow an acc that has no relation to my interest update now it cant play videos it keep saying playback error
auto refreshing feed is horrible this used to not be an issue and usually any feed updates needed to be tapped on to refresh the worst part is that you dont have an option to manually refresh the feed
please this issue really needs to be addressed it have been happening for long now since twitter changed to x if i am doing something important in the app i will just get logged out for no reason sometimes i wont even be able to log in again for almost hrs this issue keep occuring constantly and when it happens all data is always lost please it is very very annoying and frustrating
overrun by nazis owned by a fascist constant issues with running and loading the app ai scams ai prn ads that harass and straight up dont work let alone dont even make sense youll get ads for things like hamburger with no link if you didnt enjoy twitter back when it was real dont download this app now its much much worse
this platform is a total waste of time the algorithm is so messed up that i never see posts from the people i actually care about its filled with endless ads and irrelevant content the user interface is clunky and hard to navigate and the app crashes constantly ive tried reporting issues but i never get a response im so disappointed with this platform im switching to something else
well besides its user the app seem to be greatly working however whenever i connect my phoneor as soon as i disconnect or switch my connection from mobile data to wifisame the other way around nothing wants to work like i have to close the app like times or wait a good m its the only app i have this issue with
i havent experienced any of the technical difficulties so many other reviews have mentioned the app runs smoothly i appreciate the freedom of speech the platform offers and the speed with which news travels over the app x has become so prominent in need that often major announcements are made through it rather than main stream media
this app is so unstable constant crashes stuff not loading and the ratio of ads to posts its been for ads and its mainly the same ad from temu elon taking profits over user experience has really destroyed the app blue users being at the top of replies you see blue checks for a solid mins of scrolling most accounts with blue are bots farming for engagement so the person that made them can make money not sure how much but it has to be worth it considering how many there are
ads are everywhere now and they block the content the block feature no longer works ai is integrated everywhere in the app and just bombards the main feed this app is unusable now
it keeps locking me out of my account and asking me to prove that i am human ive done the ackose and email verification more times than i can count and every hours i still get locked out of my account of recent when i get locked out no verification page comes up just a blank page loading for hours and then i have to write to your customer support just to unlock the account both the app and web version sucks of recent
since algorithmic changes started favouring subscribers over nonpaying users things got different then this summer musk amplified himself and usa right wing voices after that the boosted voiced have been loudly stating how unfiltered x is its not anymore
since becoming x more issues than before i cant load my bookmarks on the app nor the page the fyp sports dont load properly overall it seems like this app is in a downward spiral and dont even bother trying to get help from their help pages because it wont and theres no real people who can assist
video buffering issues ive been facing constant video buffering on x twitter for the past days despite having a stable highspeed connection my video states to buffer after secs of the video its making it difficult to enjoy content on the platform i hope the developers fix this issue soon for a smoother experience
app keeps crashing stuck on login loop everytime i open it i have to forcibly close it and then restart it at least times each time i want to use it
stupid completedly stupid trending is gone from the for you tab its instead is showing articles for you tab helps me to twitte according to the topic that are showing in trending which are based on the fandom topics but now its just articles only trending that i can see are the top trending in the trending tab but for you sports entertainment in these tabs there are just articles not trending topics
very interactive i do think you can regulate it more by requesting that whoever opens a page pays a monthly quarterly or annual plan i would also lock all profile photos if people want to change them they will have to pay why this will stop people from creating fake pages if they are required to pay a fee money talks lastly create a dating link because many think this is a dating app anyway businesses do not want catcalls
well made app thats improving constantly my only annoyance with it when you open it it shows tweets and then refreshes the feed before you get to click on one that looks interesting either refresh on open before showing tweets or dont refresh automatically at all
i used to love twitter it has always been my favourite kind of social app but ever since it turned to x it not only lost its colours it also declined in every aspect there is now that theyll remove the option of opting out of your posts and interactions being used to train ai basically allowing stalkers to view your posts even after blocking ill do something i havent since ill move to another app i miss you twitter ill be so much happier being out of x
last year on realising that it costs me more rs month to subscribe to x via google play i renewed my subscription using my desktop which costs me rs month it was the last day of an ongoing subscription yet the next day rs was deducted from my bank account i was unduly made to pay rs for the basic x subscription for the month that started on asking both x and google play store passed the buck i never got the extra amount refunded crooks either x or google
im so sick of this app not working minimum of twice a day nothing will load for an hour or two its annoying when i want to get information especially with last nights debate i am hoping and wishing it doesnt do it for the vmas tonight as someone who likes to engage in pop culture and views this event as somewhat of a superbowl its awfully annoying and unpredictable when the app decides to do this please get this fixed its been occurring for a couple months now
since the audio video calls launched i couldnt use this feature properly i used it once and then problems keep appearing every time someone tried to call me via the app i found myself out of and the whole page crashed i cleared the cache re install the app agian but with no vain my phone is android samsung galaxy
whenever i scroll through anywhere it will automatically load back to the top if its supposed to a feature it isnt a good one also getting to ads in a row is ridiculous update ive gotten ads in a row update ive gotten ads in a row update consistent crashing after a couple minutes of opening
the most recent update made the block function completely useless anyone you block can still see everything you post this not only defeats the purpose of a block function but also is potentially dangerous because it enables stalkers among other things
yeah this app and site absolutely suck none of the updates are actually beneficial hell the app refuses to work at all if my phone is charging its like all of the developers got replaced by walnuts and even then i bet walnuts could program better than anyone working on this forsaken app its wild to watch the app go from decent to downright unusable over the years
i tried to be open minded but regretfully the algorithms in this app suck to high heavens and only recommend politics crypto and porn im not following or am interesting in any of that so why am i served cesspool content hugely disappointing and over hyped app the interface itself and the technology behind is actually pretty great shame that the above brings an otherwise good app down into the mud
constantly crashing and being buggy feed is full of random nonsense that no matter how many times you click you dont like it the same ads still show up no i do not want a my pillow no i do not want to play digital monopoly the app just keeps barreling downhill by the day
currently undergoing many changes and not for the better you must first off opt out of all ai otherwise your tweets and images will be used to train it more recently they are removing rhe functions of the block feature anyone blocked will be able to view your posts but will be unable to interact with you a very risky safety concern and anyone worried about possible stalker activity will absolutely need to put their account on private
it keeps crashing even though ive cleares the cache and my data feels so uncomfy whenever i open dm it will crash and when i open it again suddenly all of my account was logged out please fix this issue not only me but happen to several people too also a lot of annoying ads keep appear
app wouldnt load frequently not because of slow wifi but the app itself is the problem it only works properly sometimes and there are times when i cant use the apps translate option twitter was so much better before dont know what happened now
keeps logging me out for some weird reason the app keeps logging me out of my account randomly and i have to re login again and again it definitely aint the fault of my phone because i have plenty of storage left and i am using the flagship samsung phone so i believe the problem lies with the servers very disappointed
couldnt find anywhere to report a bug scoreboxes for sports events are just blank now you can click on it and it opens but you dont know what youre clicking on since the box is just a blank gray square the live sports post threads for games is so much of my reason for using the app
great app needs the bugs for spaces worked out once i noticed that the x icon is not in the system notification bar for a currently joined space i know that minimizing the app will stop the space i always have to clear my storage and cache to get it to come back please work on spaces
whats wrong with your app first of all my account was signed out by itself then when i try to login again it keeps saying oops something went wrong whenever i tried to log in update man this app is getting worse every video cant be loaded without buffering and theyre always blurry low resolution dont tell me to check your internet connection other apps run smoothly only x doesnt
the refreshing constant feed is already annoying and the elimination of a lot of useful tools inside the app like moments for different tweets archive and close friends that actually did help on privacy issues unlike hiding likes and as well the playing videos option that is still not fixed after months of being report makes this app very annoying for the average user let alone all the sex bots you get even under family friendly posts a shame damn and now block option is useless trash
the only social media platform that exist where beneficial insights real news and much more interesting things can be found however woke ceo remnants of dei policy porn harmful bs ads lack of color customization features to have preferred ones disappearing postsreposts frequent technical issues and some useless recommendations are making it bad forget everything app that clatter your space one purpose app is preferred dont ruin x by chasing the mirage of trying to satisfy everyone
just straight up doesnt work while charging it will open to your last feed and wont refresh wont play video wont let you like or comment wont let you check notifications and wont let you search or dm it just gets completely bricked this happens only when charging and no other time
havent been able to change the username on a brand new account or any accounts in over days due to rate limit even though ive not even spammed it and i cant get help anywhere on x support without having to pay to dm the page since none of the help forms on their site work for my case specifically and i refuse to spend money to fix a basic problem that shouldnt be happening in the first place tried several devices platforms even other wifi nothing works absolutely useless
app is completely unusable anymore continously crashes cant send or receive dms dont even think about pictures or videos dm notification sometimes arrive hours later in bulk after ive already seen msgs on pc resulting in mins of alert sounds not to mention the extreme amount of bots and scammers that now litter the app making it absolutely useless for anything company also now openly steals ip personal information etc which breaks terms of service and many laws
update my review on for this app actually i need giving the minus star but it doesnt have i love twitter but since it became x everything has changed for the worse there are millions of bots and the platform is full of bugs its frustrating in every way the new policies also disrespect creators allowing ai to steal artistic identity
terrible app cant be used when phone is charging this issue has been here for almost a year now and still no fix recently another problem has come up videos get playback error so you cant watch videos its crazy that this app got worse
its getting worse and worse dms are unstable as many as posts doesnt post but the first youll know is when you next try to post and find something saved in your drafts the ads are obnoxious and often as frequent as posts some arent flagged as ads and some you cant block i only stay because i made friends here but x is awful bring back twitter
barely functioning app nothing loads dms dont work they make constant asinine changes that ruin user experience tons of political interference going on and people say hateful things because theres no moderation which tends to be at the top of your feed tons of conservative ads are pushed and when they remove the block feature you will have to endure the content or uninstall this app is dying and its intentional tragic end to what was once a great platform
premium account activation issue worst service its been days since i paid for x premium but not yet recieved premium features theres no way to contact customer support also i didnt expect something like this from x this can happen to you also be careful
i want to know why you guys keep logging me out of my x account and the app entirely i have not had an issue with this for more than to years of me using until this year this issue started the moment i want to use the app its either im logged out or i have to authenticate right now i cant even log in anymore and its frustrating please fix this problem cause i use this app almost everytime
the x app has become virtually unusable on my android phone of late content takes a while to load scrolling is slow and the whole thing just seems to freeze occasionally ill get a black blank screen yesterdays update has made no improvement
constantly slow randomly goes down too many outlandish ads you have to pay for support for anything every half decent feature is being removed and put behind a paywall i cant even change my display name back to something that clearly isnt harmful simply the word winter the name i go by thanks elon
absolutely terrible i was really enjoying the app and then all sudden it kicked me out and now it wont even let me create another account and i thought a lot of this stuff had been figured out and it was at a most inconvenient time when i was actually starting to meet some good people and make some good connections i swear all social media does is make everybody more antisocial and separate us all
way too many ads like one post and ads after all the new policies are taking twitterx whatever into the dirt i wouldnt like my content fed to ai and i dont appreciate them going against app store policies by making the block button not actually do its job blocking anyone you block can still access you ive heard bluesky is a better alternative
since elon musk took over this app has taken a very big fall its kicking me out of my account everyday and i have to log in again and again every day to the point my phone memories my password and it inputs it automatically sometimes it even says the password is incorrect which it isnt and it crashes so often i cant even explain it honestly if you dont yet have this app and are thinking of downloading it dont it is truly the most frustrating thing ever
the decision making at twitter is the most idiotic ive ever seen this isnt the peoples app anymore its elons app the new blocking feature is almost breaking privacy tos if not already is the app hardly works loading media is abismal we are going backwards here we had a great app and now its all messed up failure of an application looking for something else
x is very confusing with several payment levels i started paying month a few days ago to be able to activate sharing and other locked features i dont even pay for movie apps so this is a big deal to me but i still cant share videos from x although i can in any other app no explanation why pay for something im not getting
great when it works properly which is rare most of the time the app is stuck for hours regardless of whether you refresh it or not far to many ads too i wonder if the paid version has the issue of it not working properly
this review is for the current state of the app under elon musk besides the myriad of idiotic decisions like boosting paid bot accounts removing the block feature and the non optional autoplaying of videos into ads the app also inexplicably fails to even run properly when my phone is charging combine all that with an unreasonable bombardment of ads and you get a user experience that does not even reach the bare minimum of standards that were set years ago its genuinely pathetic
not so good facing lots of lock out issues and saying it as spam without sending the users thru mail or any form of communication account is getting suspending after buying the subscription is this the way you loot money from the peoples really frustuating to use x now a days it was really good before these money minded x our account wont go until multiple reports and for that too we will get notification from twitter side
this app has gone so far downhill the for you page will feed you the same posts over and over again it randomly refreshs so you loose the post you saw when opening the app now they are changing blocking so the people harassing you can still see you content and in nov you can no longer opt out of them using you content for ai etc
upcoming update makes app no longer safe for users those of us who are harassed or stalked by another online user rely on the block feature once this update goes through even if they cant interact with content someone who is blocked can still see and screenshot content which can lead to further abuse
i have a midrange phone thats years old and the app is so unoptimised you cant even use it while charging your phone its becomes so unresponsive while scrolling it kicks out of dms while replying meaning you have to retype out the texts you were sending blocking people takes up so much system resources and completely breaks twitter whats worse is this has been happening for months and theyve done nothing to fix it
used to love using this app but it feels so unusable now my feed is always full of stuff i dont have any interest in and cant get rid of i always end up with some very nasty and mean tweets on my home page too that are incredibly offensive for literally no reason the app breaks all the time and is a pain to use anymore miss when it was just twitter and the block function worked fine
these apps need to stop adding auto advance features to videos its an awful way to make your audience see other awful content and ads i mean the ads in a row while scrolling is enough but come on now auto scrolling to an ad or a beheading video please
since it became x it has been full of bots under every hit tweet most replies arent even related to the main tweets just accounts fishing for engagement theres so many ads now and you cant scroll past them because it just takes you back dms are lagging so bad and the app freezes a lot and force closes i miss twitter
its really gone downhill videos now automatically scroll to an ad once they finish the home feed is an absolute hellscape between the promotion of hatefulmisinformation accounts and the barrage of terrible advertisements the other day i had to go back and count because this monstrous app had given me ads in a row after that there was a single post before more ads its insane to see posts being ads most of them were the same ads too twitter used to be fun disappointing
app constantly stops loading new posts and pictures every other app will being working just fine so its not my connection it seems the be getting worse i also cant get it to stop automatically playing a new video when i watch one despite changing my settings within the app to stop auto play of the time the auto play just sends me to an add that takes up the entire screen and cant be exited without shutting down the whole app
after paying a rd time with one refund i finally got the checkmark i accidentally paid twice on and was refunded one of them after a week i was never given a receipt or any sign i had paid on i paid a rd time and got several notices saying id be approved in a few days i got the checkmark on i dont know if ill get the extra payment back or not well see thats why i updated this to stars instead of the original lol
the last few weeks it does nothing but crash when im trying to send messages with gif or sending video or audio and sometimes when just typing out of nowhere it crashes i am so annoyed its not like this is new or something
twitterx will not load new posts while the phone is charging only way to rectify this is unplug charger turn off internet connection both mobile data and wifi then close the appthen reconnect to the internet reopen the app and it works for a while
i still mainly use this app for game updates and general knowledge but besides that as of recent maybe almost about a month ago every image starts to never load even though my internet speeds are gb on both up and down it really sucks that its been happening and it seems others are experiencing as well
i have a very odd bug in which the app fails to load content when phone is placed on charge it only happens with this app suddenly refreshing the feed results in an infinite loading symbol its been like that for a long time
absolutely unusable timelines just hang while loading if you click on a tweet notification and it launches into the app it will just sit and pretend to load for minutes until you finally exit new launch will show old tweets trying to refresh feed just gets you the spinning update wheel of death and never loads i elons people are trying to launch rockets build new irobots and johnny cabs but this is a major bug thats been going on for months and is your core product fix it
disable autoplay please videos have started to autoplay random content and there was no disable autoplay option like there used to be ive searched through all settings and the help center but unfortunately support will not help me unless i pay for twitter premium there is no way to contact them without giving them money first i guess
the issue has become unbearable every time i try to send a single sentence through x messages the application crashes and closes in my face without sending the message this happens with every android i have tried i have tried more than phones and this is still happening
fix your app here i am trying to watch some small videos posted by one artist i follow and at the end of the video it outo scrolls to the next one and some times changes to videos from ppl i dont know give us the option to turn auto scroll off ohh look a soothing video auto scroll to someone yelling come on you can fix this
unresponsive to quiries and appeals unfair implementation of rulespolicies they wouldnt even specify what rule you violated very unhelpful also not user friendly theres no way to make appeal on the app you need to log in separately in a browser i really regret downloading this after years
elon plans to remove the block feature in totality effectively making it function more like discords block system people will still be able to see everything you post user safety is not the priority your posts and media will be used for a built in ai as of november as well you can not opt out of this from november
no stars at this moment but i obviously have to do in order to post im having a serious glitch problem im constantly logged out for no reason the page resets while im actually trying to scroll through and see certain posts its like i look at one video then when i go back it just rests while im trying to look at something else totally annoying
logging out is hidden layers deep the app sends some nagging notification when you log out that you should log in doesnt sync certain settings across installs eg whether to autoplay videos defaults to autoplaying video the settings search bar never finds what you want and what you know exists i have autoplaying videos turned off but it jumps to another video immediately after the one you clicked ends getting worse with new updates
ive been wondering for the longest time now months is it just me or are other people having trouble with the app now as well but now i see its not just me ive asked this question on the app and looked around to see if other people had the same issues i was having but i never came across anything picturesvideos dont load anymore and this is most of the day this used to be my favorite app to get a laugh in when i needed one but now you cant even enjoy the app anymore
im a huge elon fan so i hate to have to be critical but x is boring i keep trying to force myself to use the platform to support what hes trying to do but cant i heard about from and thought that would be fun only to find it requires an over priced subscription honestly between changing the world reknown name of twitter to x and the platform just seeming empty idk if its gon na make it hope it does but i feel like charging for this from with no free option is another huge miss
currently waiting on a refund for parts of my paid premium subscription that have never been made available to me support refuses to respond about despite exclusive premium support being something thats also supposed to be included in my subscription and answers as to why certain premium functions that i paid for have been withheld for months as a content creator having features that i pay for be inaccessible it literally affects my income for these to not be functional
literally unusable due to lag i cant open my dms or get my keyboard to populate sending gifs or pictures takes forever or crashes the app also its getting really annoying to have the app crashing every minutes especially as im trying to switch to other apps
the timeline is constantly shifting around while im trying to read it why update its worse than ever before barely usable let me read the tweets update the app hangs when i try to block or mute and often hangs while opening replies i have to kill the app each time i open it to make it work normally
anytime i open the app whatever i was looking at before closing it appears and thats it i cant load new posts cant explore trending topics and so much more i have to remove the app from recent apps and open it again for things to load this is a terrible experience
videos and pictures do not load on the app when i am on wifi ive tried some solutions online but they have not corrected the issue app works fine on my samsung tablet so it seems to be specific to the pixel pro please correct this as soon as possible
the app now auto play the next video clips or showing the ads right after watching a video clip it is the worst cant i loop the same cute cat video clips that i found on this app for five hours an off option for the auto scrollauto play would be lovely please and thank you
insane amount of aibots accounts under a single post there can be fake interactions and less than genuine ones about this app id say awful amount of ads translation not working times out of still no free option to download a video bugs everywhere i have notifications for new tweets but they dont appear when i refresh i am credited for tweets i didnt write more and more posting failures and lately automatic scroll just to show us more scam ads wth
it is so bad apps always problem your account is locked need authentication your account is blocked retry page error i dont why always show it is i think this apps developer is mad mental when i use website then verify and authentication then apps is work but i dont know why they always say your account is locked actually they do not allow independent use at all
like the look of the app not sure if i am using it as well as i could people use the term parody often but i am not sure why they do not sure what is off limits in the wording is there anyone who can explain the word parody and i have seen some rather nasty words that seem to get tossed around fairly often if men and women are upset or angry x formerly known as twitter has definitely changed for the better i believe
even with a paid subscription im only allowed to post about time day ive checked everything x help says might be causing it and theres absolutely zero reasons why it should be happening unfortunately theres no one to contact at x for help so ill be canceling my subscription and deleting the app
i like using this app to talk to my friends but sometimes it gets super laggy and keeps crashing and like half the time when i open the app it brings me back to the login screen and wont let me get through it the only option is to reboot the app and hope it doesnt bring me back to the login page
beyond slow to load anything whether im scrolling through my feed or clicking on a notification it can take minutes before anything loads edit doesnt even open anymore notifications pop up but clicking on them just brings you to the x logo and nothing else
i really miss when it was manage by twitter x now is full of bugs and weird behavior each time i press on a readmore in a tweet the app crashs or when playing videos also when my phone restarts the app stops opening untill i reinstall it again this is very bad fix the app elon
update nd oct terrible app still wont refreshupdate timeline or display images while the phone is charging meaning its often unusable once the phone is charged the apps cache has to be cleared every time for it to function my phone works absolutely fine otherwise
too many bugs in recent times videos do not load properly even if the network is working fine when the videos do load they start playing together too many spam or bot tweets this app was better way better in its early days now this app sucks
media often doesnt load app often crashes of users are bots amount of spam and advertising is absurd userbase is mostly toxic every change in the last year or two has only made the app worse and it seems like all future changes are only going to make it even more unbearable awful app in almost every way rip twitter
app constantly refreshes when you dont want it to struggles to load anything thats not an ad when it does refresh and good luck using this app if you are charging your phone and have an android app just straight up refuses to work when plugged in
app is unusable since elon took over never shows me posts from people i actually follow my feed is ads and shows the same ish posts repeating over and over despite me following hundreds of artists the number of porn bots has skyrocketed i have to block several of them daily worst its ever been the worst levels of hate speech ive ever seen uninstalling and reinstalling to try and reduce the bloat of the app also somehow deleted years of art saved on my phone storage appalling
this time is the worst case xapps most of the time always crash corrupted and sucking a huged data it will also loses signal always loading and commited an error what happened to the xteam is just look like a dry optimizer or nothing find the solution please fix this problem immediately
updated constantly asking for dateofbirth even though i have done so app opens and just spins doesnt update with new content experiencing videos not loading properly or ifyou rewind will just sit there not playing constant porn bots betting bots not to mention the constant replies and follows from dating bots then we have for you which is completely pointless another app that worked being made worse with every update
i hate how broken this app has become after it became x from videos just autoscrolling once youre finished watching them except ads it will auto scroll videos and then stay on an ad or sometimes the app will just not work for no apparent reason very frustrating and annoying
solid app with increasing potential especially with new upgrades coming in on a regular basis one upgrade that i feel would be quite important i talked to grok about this is to add the ability to listen to audiovideo with the screen turned off on the phone if i want i could do it through a browser but i would prefer doing it through the app thanks and keep up the good work
ive been experiencing issues with this app despite having a stable network connection the app frequently displays please try again later or network issue errors since this app provides exclusive news content im motivated to resolve this problem i kindly request that the app developers address there issues
well x has been really bad lately theres a lot of issues that plague the platform currently mainly with the fact that the free speech component protects and promotes hateful content and even illegal content such as videos of extreme violence and cp its only been worse because of the tos changes which tells me my content on x will be licensed to them and theyre also violating google play policies by changing the block system i hate it here
honestly i havent been experiencing all the stuff thats been going on in twitter x but why remove the iconic blue bird the app was forged on that bird twitter tweet it just made sense its an incredibly unnecessary change i get elon likes the letter x but come on youve got ta step back and realise that maybe everything doesnt need an x maybe things are fine as is update im having the loading issues
twitter is now so stupid and not reliable because theres always a glitch and a bug you will most at times get a message saying something went wrong and it keeps refreshing a page on its own and going back to the previous page and coming back to home page this rating is fake
filled with bots and scammers from a wide variety of economic classes since twitter took on its new badge of shame its really gone downhill pages dont load or are filled with nonsensical text with impossible dates i have to constantly and consistently blocking bots from following me which was definitely not an issue prior what a farce
cant regain access to account after entering my password it asks for a backup code i have attempted everything on x support page and the email that asks me to reply to it after attempting to login when i reply it comes back as undeliverable please correct this as many others are having similar issues
the newest update is horrible i cant even dm someone it always force close and each time i wanted to press enter it turned into recording abd lagged im so sad by the newest update i cant even replied to my friends dm now this is why i dont want to update much cause the older version are easier to use and dont lagged this much
elon is intent on running this into the ground hidden likes with no option to opt out intrusive auto play video ads that ignore app settings that disable auto play the upcoming rework of the block function essentially making it into how the current mute function works new tos that will feed all your posts to their ai for training with supposedly no way to opt out longstanding app bugs that have yet to be fixed that are now the better half of a year old
ive been on twitter for years to see what its become now is almost tragic this app is broken my messages crash constantly particularly bad when im replying to a message or trying to send media half of the time media just does not play thousands of accounts got hacked by a crypto scammer the other day and i started getting my own tweets served back to me as ads somehow not to mention how its just become a safe haven for fascists and racists just dyer stuff
signed in with google chose a username confirmed app crashed now i have very bad username when trying to change it says that was unavailable deactivating account requests password that i dont have because signed with google unable to get in touch with support because cant find any case even near to that going through faq links back to the same page with deactivating profile
simply put im on the fence about twitter i refuse to leave the platform and quit using it because i have lots of things there that i cant afford to lose wont spare personal details but it does stress me out a lot the glitches error messages spam bot follows crashes and server outages drive me honestly nuts sometimes i call it a dumpster fire against my better judgment but i hold out hope that twitter will improve regain popularity and become the beloved community it used to be
x is a the only form of social media which i feel truly unbiased views and information can be shared it is easy to post and repost and has become my album for things i wish to express beliefs and save in order to share with my family and friends even if they dont use the application i also like the access to other peoples insights from various backgrounds i wouldnt otherwise learn about im also not getting inundated with feed from nonrelevant groups and videos i get real updates
so far the app has been good but for the past few months the videos in app keep on pausing suddenly sometimes upto times making watching some clips a chore i figured it may be an issue of storage or cache is large but after clearing cacheeven clearing data didnt rectify the issue
i have had really bad experience with x recently it loads forever when you open it and almost every time i open x posts videos and photos are not loading properly and you can not refresh the timeline smoothly worst app right now
i use this app every day but today the trends for my country stopped working and its showing trends from another country ive reset the country setting multiple times and refreshed the app but it still hasnt been fixed i dont know what to do
love the app i never touched it when it was under the control of the last regimen because i knew it was a conservative censor machine i think its as open and fair social media app you are going to find that doesnt censor either side you can truly come to this app and here honest opinions from both sides of the isle i took one star off because the current algorithm seems to add a touch more liberals to my feed then it used to
im going to have to change to stars till the bookmarks get fixed cause they wont work on my phone but work perfectly fine on my tablet just like everyone else this happened once i updated and i hate it cause bookmarking is my favorite feature i never realized how much i use it till now so please fix this as soon as possible edit its the day after i wrote is and now the keyboard keeps popping in and out whenever i try to tweet this app is so disappointing
the app sometimes intentionally doesnt reload my timeline not because of poor internet service because other apps work seamlessly the nsfw content isnt well coordinated especially in comment sections videos not relating to a post are put ahead instead of meaningful comments but the most annoying is the lags especially because of the poor server
i use to really enjoy this app before all these changes happened probably the biggest annoyance is not being able to turn off autoadvance there use to be alternatives if i didnt want to use the actual twitter app i miss those days some of those other apps offered better features and functionality
twitter no im not calling it x has been in a steep decline ever since a certain person bought it every update has taken a vital feature of the app and either flipped it on its head or made it worse if musks objective was to destroy twitter from the inside well hes been successful so far
setting explore location is now broken after the recent update i cant set a different country to explore what is trending there it keeps showing my own country trends i deleted both cache and storage and restarted the app to no avail
this is a review of the app itself not the social media platform it has somehow become worse over time because of a new bug where after a warm launch sometimes nothing loads and i need to restart the app once or more times other unfixed older bugs include the dm function rarely ever sending out notifications
good need to be able to listen or see a mini window even when using a different app and to have it prompt you to change app settings once you get that app feature i want to watch a mini window or still listen to a video playing and do other things on my phone
the blue check bot accountsengagement farmers are absolutely ruining this app the reply section to any large tweet is absolutely unusable having to scroll through dozens of botted replies which are pushed to the top based on their blue checkmark also dms crash constantly videos almost never play trying to look at your own profile is infuriating as the repliespostsetc have absolutely no order whatsoever and now blocking is being ruined so
x is now a cesspool of disinformation not only that i am constantly having to clear the cache force stop the app for it to work and thats if it responds forget about it if my wifi falls slightly below normal high speed only reason i stay on is the small community im a part helping to amplify positive ideas fight back against widespread lies abuse
x will be by their own admission changing how blocking works this policy change will allow stalkers and abusers access to people as well as removing my ability to hide objectionable content also the app is buggy as all hell frequently i open the app only for it to decide to open a tweet no younger than hours ago and refuse to load i cant access mentions or activity at that time and my only option is to close the app and do something else for at least ten minutes
i always get logged out from my account multiple times and had to login everytime it when it happens now they suspended my account for which i tried their help center but no use it said log out and login to appeal i did that multiple times but still showing the same thing i couldnt unsuspend my account help center is just for show doesnt help a bit
been using this app for over years clearly many changes to this app but of them are unnecessary if you cant be bothered to fix whats broken stop breaking whats fixed at this point id rather them never updating the app back when it was twitter so that we dont have to deal with whatever unnecessary things we have now the sole reason im using this app is simply because of my favorite content creators idols post updates here otherwise i wouldve uninstall never return ever
think about this the same guy elon running this company x or twitter whos app i have to uninstall and reinstall daily due to its failure to retrieve new messages update its news feed or even notify you of new notifications is the same guy responsible for the rockets and technology taking people into space if he cant keep one of the most popular apps of all time working correctly then i sure wouldnt trust him to get me to space and back safely
dm and gc bug keep getting worse legit cant even open pictures in dm didnt show the latest chat months and still happening update months and it still happen apps probably a spyware update apps keep adding more ads ads after post bot keep follow you and reply bot will target your friend toochat still terrible experience update dm chat and gc super lag and crash the apps charging will make app unuseable
terrible a lot of changes made to the app that made it have less features or less functioning ones bots are rampant and extremist opinions and misinformation are constantly being pushed by the algorithm unbearable experience
terrible app obviously designed by people that have never used one not a place where intelligent people congregate though im not above that bare minimum for a social media app i would use it again if i could not have my full name displayed on every post but its been going for who knows how many years and they cant even get that right
about as stable as a soggy wafer with an elephant sat on it the app fails to login even with correct credentials because when theyre wrong it says so when theyre right it bounces to random other screens website also is in a logout loop basically rubbish
the best app for beginning to understand the complex world we live in of course not every post on x is accurate but neither are they on other social apps or in the so called mainstream media follow important people and see what they think or say rather than through biased filters that far too often distorts
idk call me crazy but not being able to optout of my data being scrapped now and people who are blocked still being able to see my posts strikes me as potentially against consumer laws this is the final nail in the coffin im reporting this app as inappropriate and moving to bluesky elon is an idiot this is ignoring how bad the app is to use in general way too many ads and if i report the ads and say i dont want to see them it will keep showing me the exact same ads
i keep having a issue where i cant open my dms with out it freezing or crashing my phone i keep having to un download the app and redownload it in hopes of fixing it but it only works for a few minutes if im lucky please fix this
like the app and content content is not for the faint of heart not giving stars because of the video player its horrible not user intuitive controls are not user friendly videos play fine but mute pause timeseek feels like controls from olden days
x literally robbed me of a whole months premium subscription they received payment and completely refused to activate premium features all efforts to contact them have been futile they are now attempting to charge for a new subscription when they are yet to honor the previous one shame
most useless rd class app no customer care service one can easily make your account suspended by using technics and you cant be able to say your problem because there is no human being to listen or solve your problem you will get only recorded reply each time also many times when you click on the instructions it opens wrong page incomplete awful app elon musk just spoilt it thank you
the app seems to get worse and worse each update lots of bugs and ridiculous policies added in that ultimately make my experience on the app much less enjoyable a lot of the features that were once free are now locked behind a paywall as well i do not see myself using this app or site much longer with the way things are now
its good overall a great experience bot accounts are annoying though work on removing or limiting bot accounts introduce a feature that allows a user to set using a number of filters the kind of accounts that can follow himher account eg accounts with x followers or posts can follow etc
not enough options in the video player my internet connection is unstable but it can load high quality videos however the app sets the quality automatically and gets it wrong every single time
at least twice a day the app stops working when it happens the timeline wont refresh i cant search for anything and i cant expand any tweets to view comments the app did not used to do this im on an android so not sure if ios users have same issue
this app has really been having issues for the last months the feeds dont load for minutes and hours at a time multiple hard restarts do not correct it so i assume its server side issues this has been tested on phones galaxy s
app auto refreshes the feed once a day that stops the app from being used for a long time several minutes and even then it some times does not update this makes the app unusuable i like using the app but this bug is killing my experience
everything turned really bad after the rebranding not satisfied at all laggy full of full screen ads refreshes while youre still on a tweet and now theyre changing privacy features on the app that isnt private anymore
my twitter vanished from my phone had to reinstall this app frequently freezes or i cant comment or cant see photos its been like this since shortly after the ownertrump lover bought the platform im only on the app to connect with other likeminded ppl but it barely operates also said owner is limiting accounts he doesnt like
help videos and images arent loading i switched off and restart my phone several times uninstall and reinstall x app my internet connection is just fine as i dont have any problem with other app it has been like this for weeks already
they still dont give a damn about accessibility adverts continue to play automatically even with autoplay off absolute trash but sadly the only way to have access to fanartists from certain countries in a reasonable way for now more and more are starting to move away
aside from the proposed removal of the block button function elon musk is using this app as a tool for his political associates especially with the elections coming anytime i see any ad by the trump campaign or any other trend that paints him well and i try to signify my disinterest by tapping not interested it doesnt go away no matter how many times i signify my disinterest the trend or ads still shows this is very bad worst even
app is slowly losing functionality i have a couple different accounts for different things and due to error my accounts will randomly log out changing my profile picture on my paid account is nearly impossible and youre about to take the block button away its not worth it anymore
elons made so many bad changes to the app its an unreliable buggy mess and now they are going to remove block functionality blocking is an important safety feature that protects people from stalkers and harassers not cool
what have you done will not open at all other apps work fine update aug app constantly crashes and does not load i open other apps and they are fine ive cleared cache and reinstalled many many many times still a constant issue wifi or g g etc fix it
very bad very very bad android version of the app even before the last update it keeps crashing and doesnt show the new feeds and takes long time to loading and the major issue is it never show the first full bookmarks and never show all my tweets that i quotes or retweet and doesnt show to me all my media or my likes what is wrong with this app it keeps head from worse to worst are they forcing all the users to pay for using the app is this their plan their hidden plan
after yesterdays update it is laggy and buggy the blinker in the message box takes a long time to appear and keyboard really takes along time to load hitting send also laggy and to appear kindly improve this as it is so frustrating
i thought the problem is my internet connection and yet it was this own app too many bloatware forceful ads makes the app run so laggy and very data consuming cmon elon i knew run some media social platform its not easy but this makes twitter really goes down try another approach and makes this app loads faster dont forget the video play is always buggy
i got suspended and locked out inappropriately all my post made since account creation has never violated x rules i made an appeal on the app and also sent an email for over a month now no response i tried creating another but was restricted app keeps crashing and too many ads even though i subscribed to premium services
great app but we need a way to sort collect bookmarked tweets they cant just be stored vertically we need a search feature for bookmarked tweets we need a bookmark system that is easy to use you may even copy the one on instagram please make this happen elon
app is breaking its own tos introducing an update that renders the block feature useless as it will allow blocked users to see content uploaded by the accounts if those who have blocked them in other words if one has a problematic person following them they block said problem person that problem person will still be able to see and interact with content posted by person who blocked them
only social media app with correct algorithm but seriously it needs to check gruesome videos and photos of dead bodiesanimal cruelty etc which are openly circulated an actual murder video also appeared in the feed once and when you hide graphic content in settingsit hides memes
i keep on being signed out temporarily and i need to refresh the app multiple times forced close open repeat before my account data is retrieved and when i open dm sometimes it closescrashes suddenly can you fix this issue
app works better than ever and elon has turned the woke nonsense off now allowing free speech should do better at removing fake bots though also video or audio streaming should not require screen on and app open i like to listen to audio of long form videos and its a pain when the app closes cause i need to restart app and video
cant bookmark anymore also everytime i tried to open the app its starting from the login section though ive never log out before i close the app in the first place its really annoying and its happen literally many times already
the app has developed into a fish market by members posting any stuff anything from vitriol anger obscenity hatred etc the solution is to make it obligatory to reveal identity both photograph name location etc limit post to around chs decline improper and vulgar tweets and do away with differentiation of blue tick etc which looks feudal the second issue that has developed recently is the videos attached to the incoming posts not playing continuously buffering issues pl fix it
videos keeps playing in a loop while scrolled way past to others why does multiple vids play at the same time even hiding app or switching to another app i can still hear the audio i have to close the app before it stops really irritating considering uninstall soon
very disappointed with x twitter my account was blocked without any clear explanation just a vague message saying i violated xs rules the worst part is i havent posted anything on my account page yet they blocked me and even threatened me not to open another account this lack of transparency and poor communication is extremely frustrating what exactly is the problem and how can i fix it if im not even told what i did wrong
this app has been borderline nonfunctional ever since elon decided he wanted to purchase twitter every single day i am unable to use the app for hours images wont load cant scroll its completely stuck with a buffer icon at the top its absolutely ridiculous i havent even begun to mention all of the prnbots that have infested the space its like he bought twitter just to run it into the ground like a kid purposefully breaking a brand new toy or dog ripping up a fresh new plushie
please update the video player videos and sound lag so easily even after quitting the video it plays for quite awhile in background its definitely better than the old ones but there are still ways to go
very frustrating for some reason randomly the feed stops refreshingthe pictures and videos and all media just goes blank and all you can see is the text it take hours sometimes for the app to recover from that state
needs to be fixed immediately when you are writing a tweet it always separates the emoji from the word and carries it down to the next line by itself im tired of the tweet looking different from how it is on the feed versus how it is on my homepage versus how it is when you open it up to expand it it is extremely hard to write a tweet to make it fit all three of those different form factors it needs to be one form factor the first time and stay that way
for all the efforts to get the blue check personal verification it would be nice if they were more aggressive with eliminating bots and incredibly inappropriate posters not an app if you cant handle criticism but most of it is hatemongering which this world needs a lot less of being held accountable for what you say didnt go away because we were locked down as a society as a people we need to treat each other better
not sure if anybody experienced this but the app is very glitchy it is slow and laggy at first i thought it was my phone so i havent been using it for a while but i bought a new phone with gigs ram expandable to not bragging but i am still experiencing the same problem
twitter x is a very wonderful app i love the frequently updates made and cool user interface my only challenge is about troubleshooting my app normally freezes moreso when im engaging with others i update the app i dont post rapidly i clear caches but i dont know why i still face that challenge it makes me sick
the app stops working at random times and is unusable the only reason you want to use the app is to see official news companies and popular people but due to many leaving after the new tos was announced and the block option not working as it did you will also encounter bots bots bots and again bots but postingwell you know the amount of misinformation has grown to a large issue after the purchase two years ago you seriously do not want to use this app
th app works well except one thing if someone posts an imagephoto i can not read the comments on it because there is no text o click and if i click on the image i can only see itbut the comments dont show please fix it thanks
hey developers of x what the hell is that kindly resolve the issue with your app two videos play at the same time while scrolling i hope this issue can be resolved by enlarging the videos like facebook one video at the page in one time
the app has just gotten worse and worse over the last couple years of the time i open it and nothing loads it decides when it wants to work sometimes one account will work fine and the other account doesnt load anything
why you guys dont give features like ios x app when i upload the video it crush down and make it quality to worst the group chat dissappear itself after some time need to log out and log in again please try to fix this problem thank you
amazing app with a few glit glitches previous video keeps playing when moving on to the next video i need to close the app and shut down manually apart from that free speech is king tips please have a function that allows for english only as i cant readunderstand arabic chinese etc
i have been using this app since it was twitter i had no issues then but now from last to months i have been experiencing very bad all the videos even images are taking time iternity to load you cant load a video in single time worst worst worst
ever since the change from twitter to x it has become a social media platform that has went from bad to worse optimal features being changed or denied privacy at risk ai being trained with personal and private data and tweets absolutely the worst
disappointed that x continues to fail its basic functions constantly bombarded with useless adverts and content you would never have been subjected to unless followed before rebranding from its predecessor twitter subscription fees ahead of any response to platform issues and fixes is this yet another example of money ahead of any moral compass
bad everytime i go onto my data this app just dont run right at all cant click on videos and partially load for two seconds only until i have wifi itll work and my data runs fine for everything else and is on all the time for the apps i use most
great app when it works times of the day when it just wont refresh currently hours behind wont update forced restart and nothing been happening for months now just seems broken and possibly forcing us to a paid subscription
ive update the app to the newest version and im not comfortabel with it im using android for x and since the newst update the app always force closing when i open direct message there are also some bugs that make me uncomfortable like lagging and force closing app please fix it as soon as possible
worst app ever it lags and freezes it is very slow and kicks me out of the app once its done freezing my phone starts to overheat but it doesnt do that with other apps would give stars if i could
subscribing for a more stable experience this isnt something to pay extra for it must be part of the ux from the st bootup crashes vids freezing ads from dropshipping scam artists ad accounts that cant be deleted all this takes away from what used to be a good app the amplifying of racists misogyists is yet another letdown
worked for years but the last two months have been a nightmare video playback is a constant issue and the app crashes frequently im updated but the android experience continues to decline
i dont normally write reviews but since elon took over this app it has become so terrible that i have to putting aside every trash update leading to this moment this most recent update now lets your posts be fed to train ai if this wasnt bad enough on its own blocking someone now no longer serves a single purpose they can still see your posts regardless screw this app use bluesky
its gotten worse and worse since elon took over it was a good little app we all loved musk murdered our little blue bird app and made the icon and branding look more like a porn site than a social media platform edit to add it would be really lovely if locked accounts could have the active timer shown on some part of the screen just learned theyre removing the block button and thats literally against google play policy
way too many bots no up to date open source codealgorithms the algorithm itself prioritizes big accounts too much and the moderation policy is arbitrary the app is buggy contains way too many ads and continues to include new deceptive design patterns
pictures and videos consistently show up then disappear to resolve i need to go into the app and clear cache each time there hasnt been one update to this app that has made the user experience better its pretty disappointing how far its fallen
stupid app wont let me turn off autoadvance on videos i should be able to scroll when i want to i dont need some lazy feature to hold my hand to the next video like all apps this feature is available on an ios horrible feature that no other scrollingapp has
very buggy the past few weeks it keeps me off randomly and says im not authorized to view these posts im just reviewing the list to approve or deny followers please fix also when i login it shows i have followers and following as the refresh takes a few minutes and my profile picture is missing and the list item for the pending followers disappears for a few minutes the devs messed up real bad for the latest release this is unacceptable do more regression testing
as the years go by with every update since elon musk has bought this app i think to myself it cant get worse than this surely and everytime i get proven wrong anybody can get verified as long as they pay elon which are also bots you have to dig deep in replies under posts to find a real person talk because the verified replies are favoritised no block feature basically so you cant really filter who sees your posts which can be dangerous also bots in my dms daily i do not reccomend
the only thing keeping me on this app right now is content creators i purposely block people to avoid seeing their posts and to prevent them from seeing mine because i feel extremely uncomfortable with them the block option not being able to do that for me anymore is disturbing and makes the experience so much more uncomfortable because it makes it easier for people i blocked for harassment that the app wont even deal with properly to harass me again
a platform with actually free speech it doesnt matter whats your opinion you still have the same chance on getting promoted this is extremely important for the world especially now there are problems with broadcasts and videos and that is that you cant unzoom and there is a big fat notch app is not fullscreen
i would give it stars if i could they are signing every user up to be used for ai training every post and media on x will be fed into ai whether you like it or not pictures of yourself your family artwork you create videos you share in addition the block feature now allows blocked users to view your posts despite the block exposing millions of people to content that may be upsetting or inappropriate for them to view despite your best efforts to keep it away from them awful playform
app has gotten terrible since musk took over ui gets worse every update app keeps running slower video player doesnt work and i can not believe this is a real problem the app does not work at all if your phone is charging
literally the only reason i keep this app is for the artists and friends i follow who solely stay on twitter because moving platforms can kill your views elon has sincerely screwed this app up it was fine but he had to toy with it and isnt this new blocking feature hes gon na add against tos and like privacy stuff yeah i would give it a if i could but i cant so you get a one
page refresh issues updated contentnews not visible most of the time video playback issues requires scrolling updown to play singleclick doesnt work please address these issues to improve the user experience
stars just a few glitches that keep me from giving it stars for example notifications for messages are often not delivered and it sometimes wont allow me to change my profile picture unless i do it on desktop instead of mobile
the current choices of the people running this website are made clear that it is all for the sake of only profit to the point it has become unsafe the app added my phone number to itself without my permission turning options for user information from off to on against the users knowledge and now forcefully scrubbing its platform for its ai among other suspicious decisions im trapped still having to use this for work but please if you have a choice use another app instead
locked me out after minutes had ne play a stuoid game that didnt work right couldnt figure out how to contact via phone email or chat extremely irritating if someone cobtacts me to solve problem great if not i delete tha app
forget the apps owner its the people who post that matter there is so much controversy over how this platform is maintained and promoted my suggestion is to ignore all the promotions and propaganda and seek out the accounts and people who resonate with you when you are connected with like minded individuals you can learn so much i dont pay a subscription that is my choice as i have no interest in gaining followers but i can see that it is a useful option some may benefit from
if x could get away with it they would show you the most interesting stuff all the time just to reload and take it away before you can interact with it and youll never see it again good thing it only happens twice each time you bring up the app
lately the app is performing really bad the content does not load the media does not play after countless updates the problem still persists musk is making space rockets but cant maintain this app
audio issues that allow previously watched videos audio to play over the next or new video you are watching makes it hard to watch multiple videos in a row seems like this should be an easy fix but has been going on for over a year
modern marketing is flawed i find it hilarious to see how apps try to push advertising this one likes to unmute videos if its an add when i already muted them until i want to hear it the result with me is i can realize im watching an add much faster at home if im at work i just dont use it
x is an exciting app it certainly provides a lot of fun and laughs however if there is underlying political gaming it needs to stop why are people obsessed with eradicating others they dont like were not assigned on this planet to disembowel and eviscerate each other the sooner we get to that point the better
sometime app keep runing in background playing video even when you exit and clean from background only way to stop it is to uninstall or restart device quality of app drop significantly last few months as it seems boss shouldnt stop with managment when he was take over twitter
terrible user experience notifications for posts by whoever elon is friends with are shoved down your throat no matter what you do elon musk has ruined the app its no shock millions are deactivating their accounts in favor of better safer alternatives that arent filled with bots and political extremists i use apps because i want to enjoy my time and learn more about the world around me this app is just fills its users with fear and rage this is goodbye sincerely me
app freezes horribly and continues to delete dms restarting phone and uninstallreinstalling dont fix the problem there are ads almost every other post that render the timeline basically unusable and the amount of hate speech here is disgusting if i could give negative stars i would all these five star reviews are liars or paid
ever since i updated the app is doesnt shop any pictures is like i am scrolling over texts i tried uninstall then installing again but the problem is still same even videos contents are not previewed like it used to can you kindly fix the issue
have an issue with listening to twitter spaces other than that twitter is an awesome experience a question why do tweets disappear when you tweet on facebook i was following news and sports today and the birds did a vanishing act could your tech fix and resolve this issue as well also the app isnt responding and shutting me out im trying to follow sports also i cant see the scoreboard and highlights
my favourite app is now beset with buggy problems videos wont load pages wont refresh and the app is such a pain all the time x has no parallel as a news and information siteapp elon musk please invest in some good tech to restore x to its glory once more its actually one star the extra star is due to the plethora of information in twitter yes i prefer that name too
this app now only promotes trump for president algorithm sucks too now anyone can be a verified user even if theyre your stalker as long as they pay a fee its only good for porn and even that has ads to vote for trump elon destroyed this ap now making it nothing but an arm of the right for propaganda purposes with a few good nudes photos you cant use step verification unless your a premium member making it a huge security risk worthless
where to start the app is overrun by ads both political and nonsensical in nature people copy and paste replies for engagement and to get money from twitter blue it is not and will never be x oh and the block function which i and many many others use to block accounts that spam ads or are just downright annoying or abusive is getting an overhaul and is now no longer an actual block function so twitter which before musk bought it used to be useful is now crashing and burning
i dont even care about the political stuff the actual app just sucks so badly stuff takes a minute plus to load regularly ignore you accidentally retweet something its impossible to unretweet and it just keeps the tweet when you refresh also going into any comments to gain context of a video is just loads of useless posts with like maybe real person actually engaging
the app is nothing but glitches and bugs i cant send messages without it crashing and it doesnt load my feedmessages half the time hope it gets fix asap and now its not even letting me login to either of my accounts just wonderful
constantly crashing i was using the last real twitter app before x was released and it worked perfectly then my phone died and i had to load x on my new phone maybe if they stopped firing everyone and let them fix the bugs then it would work better
used to be great but now it keeps crashing it flicks from black screen to whatever it is im doing on there then a message stays at the bottom of phone screen saying its not working properly i have to restart my phone or it remains there
honestly this is the best news app im not a bot im just an autistic dude who hates it when stuff ruins my routines x is perfect because it allows me to limit how often notifications occur it gives so much customization my wife autistic also we both use it almost exclusively what better way to get the news than from people actually in whatevers happening
garbage sometimes a lot of times the app just stopped loading images videos and comments while it loads the fyp easily why i tried deleting the cache or data it fixed it for some time then the app just decided to do its bs again fix your freedom of speech app pls
it needs some work when i do a general search with magnifyer and i have internet it comes up with in all caps no internet still happens also when i post some ats get underlined in red and when posting it says try again so must post link again and cant load posts at this time as well
crashes all the time super laggy sometimes get like adverts in a row which then makes the glitching so bad the app is unusable i have no idea whats happened to this thing but its become very very annoying to use
you have to pay to use it if you want to be seen but then its great the news gets to x before the msm theres a diverse range of interests and opinions i like the interface search grok the ai feature and the fact that you are in the same realm as your favourite people is awesome i struggle to get traffic on my page but i get plenty of views on my replies
as the time passes the app is constantly having nonsense updates the last one about the block button is inappropriate and doesnt respect the users privacy it can put people in danger of stalking and harassment
changed their policy to force us to opt in for our propertyimages videos etc to be used to train their ai and get free copyright use to not only twitter but other companies too ontop of that now anyone you had blocked can still stalk you see your posts etc so its pointless to even have a block feature now until they change back to give us the option to opt in or not and keep block features the same it will remain a star
app problem to day date sep i am facing some problem with the app whenever i tap on the typing line to chat with someone the keyboard gets locked and opens and sometimes the keyboard does not appear at all and i thought there might be a problem with my phone but i tried with phones and all of them have the same problem the problem occurs whenever we chat for more than minutes so please solve this problem and fix it your x urse
twitter is changing its block feature now and theyre changing it so that people you block can still see your posts knowing twitter and the cesspool of stalkers theyre going to be having a field day with their victims its not a usable app anymore either with all the ads theres practically more ads than actual posts now i would not recommend this app to anyone its not consumer user friendly
used to be great smooth app when it was twitter since it became x the app is buggy as hell it often wont load content and i have to keep closing and reopening the app unlimited number of times hoping it would work worst app on my phone right now among the ones i use daily extremely frustrating
the app is slow the app wont let me add a gif or pic theres constantly this message that pops up saying can not retrieve messages at this time please try again later also my posts are never seen whats the point of this app if you are invisible and cant communicate with others
account got permanently suspended for supposed suspension evasion when i havent ever been suspended and have rarely interacted in this app thats what i get for following donald trump and other right wing celebrities what a shock now when i try to submit appeal because this is either clearly a mistake or a purposeful attack the app is bugged and wouldnt let me it says i need to log out and when i click log out it sends me to an error page it wouldnt let me submit the appeal
crashes at least once every mins overheats my phone sends me app not responding pop ups over other apps bordering on completely unusable using this app is like pulling out your own teeth and trying to shove them back in again im in hell
x formally known as twitter intends to remove the current block feature and replace it with one that does not fit the needs of the feature as such the app is now in violation of the tos of the google play store and should be removed for download immediately opting out of their ai learning service will also be taken away as an option as such i do not suggest artists use this platform to share their art unless this change is rolled back
the newish development of clogging up my timeline with enormous picture ads is infuriating ive selected not to display pictures on my feed i have to tap into the tweet these ads override that setting the good thing about twitter ads was that that were in keeping with ordinary posts subtle these picture ads are loud and idiotic if the idea is to annoy people to pay for twitter it wont work stop these ads elon
x crashes constantly is full of bugs slow to respond and should you dare to even think of charging your phone while using it it enters a permanent buffer state bots and engagement bots run rampant zero moderation for racism sexismetc promotion of historical common sense bad guys is spread by the algorithm while honest journalism against the owners political preferences are banned legacy features are removed for the sake of innovation such as removal of blocks just awful
since this app was re purchased and poorly rebranded it has done nothing but to fall downhill its algorithm and performance get worse everyday and its pretty much an open platform for adult content prn and hate speech no need to say its owner has turned it into a political propaganda machine and has basically ruined the whole thing if the features keep downgrading due to poor decisions like its been doing it the app will be worth negative amounts in a matter of months
i love the variety of stuff i can see hear and interact with though it is a bit buggy it starts jumping videos if you like a post tried on diff phones same happens every time
apparently even the latest update cant save this app from constantly crashing constantly needing to be force closed constantly needing cache emptied not evening improving if i resort to restarting my phone half my time on the app is trying to troubleshoot why im only seeing a half loaded mess of blank posts and icons
thanks for changing how the block button works internet safety is not a concern here clearly the ai pushing worsens the overall experience too and the app hasnt worked properly ever since musk acquired it rip
i cant create an account i have tried so many time and everything so far tried switching between data and wifi even i had strong network connection but every time they say something went wrong try again i am so sick of this there are some content which can only be found on x otherwise i wont be bothered with this app plz fix this soon
over the past couple of years i have seen this app devolve in terms of reliability engagement and user experience theres clear misinformation being promoted and the only time i see a factcheck or additional information provided is for what most would consider trivial posts the amount of bots and and fake users has also seemed to have grown lastly theres a clear monetary incentive to promote engagement so users would rather say something untrue and provocative not a free speech area
this is now a useless app i think they should consider selling it to good developers or they should change it for reading news only media doesnt load the sound of one video will be for all the videos settings doesnt apply
i see alot of folks talking about how this app crashes ive never had it crash once it might be time to update your phone or maybe even upgrade if you continue to have issues the app woks fine maybe just maybe folks think its crashing because they dont like the fact that they might be reading post they dont like
almost completely unusable at this point text wont load pictures cant load video doesnt load issues persist for hours even after force stopping and reopening all of the ads are really strange pretty much have to use the browser version full time now masterful gambit sir
all these ads changes to features that kept the app safe like restricting hatefulfalse information unverifying accts to push a subscription service its awful this app is just awful now they want to get rid of the block feature so elon can stalk his exes like the loser he is
there is literally no working appeal process or support team at all on x a post of mine was wrongly autoflagged as violent speech and i was instantly given a day suspension i cant submit an appeal at all my attempts to start the process are always met with a message wrongly telling me im not signed in to a suspended account all other attempts to reach support are answered with bot emails that tell me i must reply to confirm my email address and then instantly autoreject my replies
the android app is clearly an after thought constantly crashes media doesnt load notifications repeat or dont come through at all do yourself a favor and use the the mobile website instead
lately this app keeps on having trouble to load i thought the connection was the problem but apparently other apps are running smoothly with no any issue never had any trouble with the old twitter now it just keeps getting worse
if i could give twitter stars i would my first problem was a month ago when my dms crashed when i texted a specific person yet it worked well for others i got logged out and kept getting logged out until i deleted the app and reinstalled it why are you changing the purpose of the block button the block button helps people block creeps stalkers and weirdos to nsfw accounts they block minors and anyone who isnt the intended audience also people who cross boundaries
by november they will have implemented nonopt outs to consent for genai data scraping and the removal of the block button alongside its growing number of ads fa being only a premium paid feature this has become unusable if i could give this stars i would
it has been quite a horrific experience for me when scrolling in the for you page two or three videos play themselves simultaneously i dont know what the problem is fix ur app
x is broken dm always closes while in the middle of typing now opening dm just crashes the whole app not even mentioning cant retrieve posts now where the worst suggesting system on timeline is the ads aggressively flooded everywhere and contents trashed with fake bots posts
i really enjoy checking up on current events but if you say youre not interested in an ad it shouldnt appear again mins later i dont know how many times ive said i dont like an ad or not interested in an ad and the next time ive opened app i see the ad again it gets quite annoying always telling an ad youre not interested yet it continues to show up
elon musk ruined this app the app worked perfectly until he decided to buy over the company and slowly over time the app degraded to this pile of st the app is slow and laggy ads you have dismissed and specifically told that you dont like will come back the app is scrolling itself up to adverts when you like a post or retweet the bots situation is out of control users are just farming with content thats not theirs of ads are scams as all the real companies have left the platform
it appears that we have the most qualified individuals developing this application yet it has not excelled since elon assumed controlfrequent crashes and persistent glitches persist despite my premium payment yielding no improvementenvision if this functioned flawlesslythis is unparalleled anywhere
the update sucks cant refresh the home cant see the post comments better open on webs the apps keep stop working also too many same ads imagine you scroll posts but ads coming like to in order update still unstable better experience on webs and ios
videos autoscroll on android and theres no option to turn that off like on iphone which is ridiculous and annoying sending dms is also incredibly slow now every time you press the button it takes about half a second or more to actually send
this app is literally unusable at times i cant even go in dms without it freezing up in fact twitter in general freezes up every minutes it even kicks me out when i want to watch a video please fix this
i appreciate the new features and it being far less censorious than other platforms but flaws persist you have to find a video to begin scrolling and sometimes previous videos continuously play until you force close the app feeds also refresh at will which is irritating the suggested content tweets videos can be great but are deeply flawed i am currently overwhelmed with anti india content and i have no interests that are even remotely related to this content
riddled with engineering problems for the longest time videos wouldnt load american political agendas are being shoved on my feed im european i dont need to see that bots are worse than ever posts have turned into clickbait nonsense now they are taking away privacy everything i loved about twitter has gone i can accept x now because twitter would never be this bad
i have two issues with this app if its been up for a short time its extremely slow when i try to switch from my timeline to my notifications sometimes i have to exit the app and go back in to get it to work im tired of having to be on it constantly throughout the day because if im not i lose timeline entries and i can not see everything since my last timeline check this is very frustrating
if you have a high traffic group chat good luck typing out anything absolute total garbage ui always that same stupid message can not retrieve messages at this time please try again later no fix your stupid app
everly since they switched twitter to x this always logs me out and tells to reverify that am human being or not or log in again and it is annoying now cant gain access into my account now it has crashed again by showing me something went wrong you have exceeded the allowed number of attempts please try again and when i type the trying again it doesnt work
i really wanted to like it but log in and making account issues are simply not acceptable on an app of this popularity it was confusing creating an account and still have no idea how i did it and then trying to log back on proved that my confusing was valid received many emails telling me is have to go through a bunch of questions on my return i returned and deleted my account i truly hate social media and cant see how anyone would bother with censored platforms and fake posts
something seems just wrong with the android version certain times of the day it simply stops working then takes what seems like an age to come back refreshing doesnt w hopefully itll get better soon
ive been using x mainly to stay updated on sports and its been great the app runs smoothly with no freezing issues and its easy to follow everything from news to entertainment one of the standout features is the freedom of open expressiontheres no worry about speech restrictions so people can share their opinions freely which is refreshing these days overall x offers excellent performance and keeps me in the loop on everything i care about great app
freedom of speech being protected is great and much needed in this new world of control but the app itself has some issues stuff never likes to load auto refreshes when you log into app notifications in dms are hit or miss ussually misses
its pretty good but the options i get on web are much more efficient the app should be better than the website but here its opposite x app is good but there are many glitches like we can not schedule our post through app which is very easier and more efficient but for this we have to go through website
i like it its real uncensored it seems to only crash on latest operating systems i run old android no issues seems the functionality may be more device software owner initiated than the apps fault does not surprise me in the least never stop questioning never give blind trust
this app used to be so good until elon musk ruined it all introducing a feature that basically makes the block button pointless can endanger many people who are being stalked the functions are all stupidly laggy sometimes you cant even change your profile picture its a nightmare
i love x so much from the very beginning the only tiring thing right now is that my account keeps getting suspended permanently for no reason and i cant appeal i know the rule and i dont violate any soi think the team needs to look into this there are a lot of persons with same issues apart from this issuex is really super cool and thats why im giving a star instead of when its fixedi will be back to rate thanks
the app continues to get better since the old twitter says many many new features have been added some locked behind the premium paywall but overall it has gotten a lot better it does have a few glitches from time to time that eventually do get fixed and it is a bit of a memory hog as well as the every so often timeline refresh that makes you loose your place on something you were looking at but outside of that which has been a inherent issue since twitter began pretty much
frequent crashing on android basically since elon took over ive tried everything to fix and nothing is working one minute it works and the next it just loads non stop and i just have to close the app and try again later
so many issues dont get notifications about half the comments left in my posts when i click on a notification that someone liked a tweet its a chance it will take me to the tweet or the person who liked it page more and more words ive muted are showing up on my timeline shows me accounts that have blocked me the new replies leaves me seeing the same posts over and over again it makes everything looks so messy and ugly tried twitter support but they havent replied to me
soon to be removing the block features use and automatically using every single post comment repost image and video as ai training data this app is becoming increasingly unsafe for minorities artists abuse victims musicians and many others i encourage using bluesky instead it is much safer devoid of bots and doesnt use your data to train robots to replicate and steal art music etc made by real human beings
elon musk is a gross billionaire shrill cry baby who ruined this app first calling it x and not twitter is a crime second the app freezes and loads so poorly now that when im just trying to get an update or look for something it takes over an hour sometimes several to get over this issue third ai and adds are becoming more prevalent and annoying and make me despite accidentally clicking on one the other or both it sucks
i used to enjoy it but now a lot of users with blue badges are annoying since theyre only looking for engagement they terminate the block function which protect me from unwanted content the ad is something i dislike i need twitter that i like back
cant look at more that a few posts a day half the time its either so slow or just straight up frozen and good luck if you want to open a video check comments or see what kind of notifications you have
privacy is being compromised when on this application its been threatened that the same privacy will be removedchanged and the force of an additional feature that i want nothing to do with especially with the constant postings of misinformation even when its still corrected
its a bad joke at this point littered with bots and neo nazis half the features no longer do what they originally claimed by design also the only app ive ever had in my life that now immediately stops working whenever the phone is plugged into a charger this seems to only affect android users someone please buy the site back from that weird little freak manlet elon musk because it used to be one of the best for following journalists and getting news in real time now its a chore
theres no way to remove auto scroll now and you can actually get fed pretty badly by some malevolent ads some people have began accidentally opening these ads trying to pause them only to open them up and up downloading viruses or getting their information stolen how is this acceptable the app is also extremely biased flagging anything that may be considered as woke meanwhile explicitly hateful content is never removed from the platform its a mess
as of september the current version of the app does not load photos oh except ads it loads those just fine even profile pictures wont load but video ads work great and load instantly thanks elon
this terrible app keeps getting worse notifications are sporadic if they appear at all and lately the dm feature has become almost unusably slow repeated un and reinstallations havent helped at all
why does the app keep logging me out after ive been on it for minutes it happens once a day when i check it itll kick me out after minutes and make me re log in keeps auto refreshing after looking at a thread change it in my settings to where it shouldnt be doing this why does it keep doing this this app hasnt been good for some years now maybe just go back to basics and make sure that it works i dont know what elon is doing but yall suck now do better
making the block button essentially a second mute button is extremely dangerous and violates peoples privacy they make it so that even when you block someone they can still see your tweets which is the absolute opposite to why people block others in the first place this goes against the privacy policy on all app stores and seriously needs this fixed
experience has degraded substantially over the last year especially privacy and discoverability platform is essentially dead for me unable to find the posts i wantperformance issues crashes etc
id give it a zero if i could elon ruined a great app now its just bots right wing conspiracy theorists and evony game apps all the time plus it never works wont load for hours at a time but i guess thats only an issue for those that dont pay complete disaster of an app
this app is a dumpster fire and the only reason im riding it out until the end is because my favorite artists post on here this place is riddled with bots crypto scams horrible bigots emboldened by elon musk and any other kind of nuisance that finds a home in social media not to mention the constant glitches crashes and freezes go to bluesky instead
since elons takeover x has stopped working without hiccups even surfing x has become so cumbersome that pictures videos couldnt be played or downlaoded x keeps me logging out again and again doesnt enable login without app reinstalled please bring the old twitter back
im surprised the playstore hasnt caught that code elon had his team write in which allows them to open phone cameras turn on mic read search history see contacts texts and all media like videos and pics on any essentially spy on any device with x downloaded on
the block option was recently changed such that all your posts are still visible to anyone who is blocked the only options to avoid that is deleting your account or making it invisible to anyone horrible product design and it should not be allowed to do that if its not against policies already
the site has turned toxic extremly transphobic and harmful to queer artist and anytime i report an accout for threating or posting graphic content nothing is done about it theres also be glitches recently i cant update my pfp i cant get notifications and i keep getting messages froms bots instead of my actual followers it also wont let me comment sometimes its crazy and nothing is being done about any of it
they have changed the block button to no longer actually block someone instead the blocked person can no longer comment on your posts but can still see everything you post on top of openly admitting that they will steal your content to feed ai in their terms and conditions and there is nothing you can do about it besides just not posting when x is such an integral part of networking for artists and other content creators really disappointing
i see a post i wan na interact with it or just look at it some more timeline randomly refreshes why the hell it still works like that after years of people complaining about it even aside from obvious problems like most of the users on the site being bots and the real humans having less claim to sentience than bots the app itself is bad and it always has been all the innovations just make it even less usable but thats just an industry standard now for some reason
this app has literally become one of the worst apps the timeline does not load no photos no videos no posts and allmost daily updates are useless the problem has been going on for a long time and no solutions have been found one star is too many for this app
one truly can not understate how bad this app has gotten since the name switch and it only gets worse every year if there was a good alternative i guarantee half of xs users would switch instantly
unsafe to use latest updates remove the block feature and encourages harassment algorithm prioritizes spam paid accounts and malicious bots while suppressing organic conversation site now claims ownership over all user data and content without attribution including altering content without permission misdismalinformation
x breaks unexpectedly everyday i am on an android device nothing os i updated to latest version but the problem still persists it takes forever to load content in newsfeed and in search section worst maintenance and poor experience
app is totally horrible now sometimes it can freeze up for hours like it just wont work and them media content sometimes you got ta do a little prayer before they open if theres was less that one star i would give it that or maybe youre intentionally doing it to nonpremium users
great for getting all the trending news and stuff immediately as they happen however there is an element of false news in some instances otherwise great to interact with
x is the perfect way to express our right freedom of speech since elon musk is the new owner i can honestly say that its truly unbiased and allows everyone to express their voices the only improvement i can think of is when selecting the icon the notifications are never up to date so its a bit slow but you can refresh a few times if needed
the best long running social media platform too bad they changed it from twitter to x though the only downsides are the amount of call girls and pornography you get throughout the whole app they do need to regulate the amount of explicit content that uncontrollably shows up on this app though they also need to add live features and a few other new things
great app for humanity amazing appropriate informative educational etc all kinds of information from confusing to excellent are available on this platform regarding most of the small and big information news lectures statements etc of your area state nation and international level but this application is still lacking and humans find addiction to this application extremely fatal
i would have click times that i dont like this ad option but it doesnt seem to matter i get the same ad just second later worse sometimes in a row also scrolling become either very slow or stop right at the ads to load further contents
x of late have been absolutely horrible it doesnt load videos and it keeps hanging every mins even with a fast wifi and data i still struggle to preview videos and pictures pls fix up
cant share a single post to multiple people at once cant scroll past posts on the timeline cant go without seeing the exact same posts on the timeline even when the timeline is somewhat operational and populates more than posts cant go on any post without bots being rampant what is the point of this app at this point
its a dumpster fire of bots technical and moderation issues all of which are driving away advertisers the majority of the ads are for x premium also the block button issue bluesky and instagram are a waaay better alternative with the massive influx of new ppl over the last few days most of the people i followed on x are on bluesky now with the rest on instagram gon na uninstall once i post this review
recently the videos on my timeline play simultaneously as in two or more videos will start playing and the audios will be mangled together sometimes it still plays if you close the app until you clean it from your recents
loved twitter hate x app has gone extremely jittery and unresponsive at times plus musk is a fruitcake as well as being a russian asset i write this review a couple of weeks and x is still as rubbish now as it was back then zero improvement in performance slow and hanging its just terrible
one really cool feature of twitter if you say i dont like this ad it will use that information to make your timeline better and show it to you the next time you refresh the timeline maybe theyll even put it back to back with an ad for fartpoopnft or something else unappealing because thats whos buying twitter ad space these days
in fairness this app is a great place to get updates quickly accuracy of the update is always in question but i suspect i am not the only one who knows speed matters with information speed cam be deadly to brain cells though be cautious on this racetrack of information stay safe check the information before believing what you have read
bad simply the worst app after changing ownership photos take ages to load for no reason video usually lags and had the worst resolution ever at first i thought it was my wifi connection but i had no problems opening any apps
jeopardises safety with the latest changes to the block feature the block feature should be used to protect people from stalkers offensive people and creeps who violate a persons sense of peace this new change does not help anyone unlike what they believe its supposed to do
dont know whats going on but this app has been horrible for about a year now never loads content i constantly have to back out and force stop the app in order to get my timeline to refresh not a great experience at all
too much bugs you play a video and the audio of some other video starts playing in background plus video takes forever to downloadtoo glitchy even at high speed internet and now it has stopped responding on its own
why it keep getting worse and worse i didnt get notification dm wont work dunno why i didnt see any artwork from artist that i followed when they post and i even cant scrolling through the app peacefully why does it like to refresh itself so much
ill be in the middle of typing a message to a group chat and the dm will just close and go back to my convo list completely erasing whatever i was typing and it does this multiple times this has been happening for soo long its so irritating for a while it stopped after updating the app and i thought it was fixed but now it keeps happening even after updating please fix this irritating issue
its autorefreshing every seconds or less making content disappear after its shown on screen hyperannoying please fix thank you for the fix
the more this place adds userunfriendly and outright hostile rules to its terms of conditions such as effectively removing the block feature having posts and artwork to be used for the sites ai learning and fining people k for viewing million posts within hours the more tempting it is to leave it altogether no amount of good usermade art ai images are not art memes or communities are worth dealing with the increasingly poor decisions enforced on there
i love x its a lot of fun it has a culture all its own you can make acquaintances of people with all backgrounds friends of some but you almost instantly learn of people who werent brought up in the same world learning of them their thoughts needs can be a challenging revelation but in the end we are all people maybe we live in far different places but our desires are remarkably similar for faith family peace stability creativity passion and the learning is good
my profile and interactions isnt showing up to anyone but i can still access and tweet this is serious to me and why cant anyone see my profile or my interactions x help isnt useful neither the feedback fix this bug
works very well the only issue that i could find is that while navigating through videos sometimes the sound of the previous one keeps being reproduced and i have to stop the app to fix it
absolute trash of an app since mr wannabe space man took over the app has gone down hill constant bots and spam chats and now the video player doesnt work at all seriously thinking about uninstalling if your thinking about downloading dont waste your time and constantly needing updates but never fixes anything
the worse app ever banned for no reason build a k following didnt even post and was banned and constantly getting authentication requests ridiculous no support lines or help lines they have automated replies i believe thet dont even read what you send dont build anything on this platform you will regret it alot of big names leaving the app as they have an unprofessional service and its impossible to recover a legitimate account
app continues to get worse and worse more ads less posts from people i follow and videos that autoscroll to the next one instead of ending also swiping up shouldnt bring me to the next video thats literally how i access my control buttons
every time i launch the application it prompts me to log in again after i successfully log in it redirects me back to the login screen to resolve this issue i must restart the application i have encountered this problem on two different phones
i like the information presentedyou have to filter what is right or wrong but for me it is interesting i dont like that you dont have ful access only if you pay for a subscription
xs new blocking system violates privacy and safety for its users by allowing blocked people to still be able to view your posts just cant interact x also steals all of your posts art and images you tweet and uses it for analysis for their ai which is effectively stealing woukd not recommend if youre an artist who wants to network or value your unique creativity
works well but could be more intuitive and with more ways to find and navigate posts history of what has been read would be nice
i joined twitter back in and have made alot of friends over there but over time ever since musk bought twitter he kept removing and making horrible changes to it from removing likes changing their logo etc and dont even get me started on those awful ads they produce and the trending system is broken cause you cant remove something you dont like trending on there regardless im glad i left this godawful app for good and im glad to switch over to bluesky
twitter used to be great but the lack of moderation on x has turned it toxic lifes hard enough without the harm this can cause there are much better safer platforms available now
bots galore shorter time line endless ads the algorithm wont show me the things i my account is actually about nobody can see my tweets and i get notified about half the time when someone comments on my tweets constant shaking of ai and the block button is about change to be functionally useless people you block will still be able to see what you say a rancid broken pointless app
used to be okay enough of a general social media app but slowly degraded into a cesspool of vile toxicity and hatred since aeound mid it ramped up to an exceptional and unacceptable level over the course of and is not worth using as a result i advise looking to literally any alternative
the website is great but the app sucks the app seems to lose the ability to communicate with the servers i started using chrome because the app is frustrating
gets extremely slow for long posts particularly when several people are tagged in post and more content is being added on my samsung galaxy s it becomes almost unresponsive i have to post and then undo to continue writing
unless youre forking money over to elon the app is borderline unusable you cant download anything half the new features are for people who pay and the algorithm is designed to make you angry so you stay on the app and engage in ragebait not to mention the fact that elon made it so that once you block someone it doesnt even hide your profile from them also the name and icon are just horrible x sounds like something middle school me wouldve found cool and then hatedsorry not sorry
this app is a very great app but anytime i try to purchase a premium account they tell me to try again later everything in my account is very accurate yet this thing keeps happening all the time please fix it
old tweets that i already read keep repeating after refresh very annoying edit timeline keeps refresheshing while i am reading a tweet i end up missing an interesting tweet it should be refreshed only if i click refresh i miss the days when this app was named twitter i wish i could rate half star
app constantly freezes always forced to use the web browser instead of the app because it doesnt work also you can no longer block people
almost everytime i open the app on an android device everything doesnt load properly or it cant fetch new tweets and its not a problem with my wifi or anything since its fine on most days on my ios devices this app sucks on android
repeatedly crashes autorefreshes too often and the bots are rampant quality has dropped significantly with the new ownership far less useful as a news aggregator than it used to be informed discussions are frequently drowned out by a vociferous idiocratic minority and bots did i mention the infestation of bots yeah the signal to noise ratio favors the factfree reality distortion field and bots lotsa bots
it really used to be an amazing app till it started logging me out of my own account and to make matters worse it became impossible to login back cause it shows error after trying to login back now i have been using chrome to access my x account for a month and some weeks now its really sad
its fallen off big time i had ads backtoback also it competely fails to load any tweetsposts too frequently its mostly kept going by the legacy accounts on there but the site and app themselves are in decline
loading the app itself is god awful there should be no reason why i have to close and reopen the app hoping for something better to happen twitter was never like this and it pisses me off more when i lose track of videos i was watching especially when a playback error happens complete dog water
new update is constantly moving the feed from what youre currently reading to the nearest ad even when scrolling away it brings it back to the center of your feed again horrible user experience
the block feature is useless now with the new update when you are blocked by someone you are still able to see their page and posts but not interact with them
it autorefreshes too damn often and i cant even turn it off its to the point where if you read the comments or check a profile for a bit it will refresh terrible app if you already have an account i recommend you to use twitter lite instead
the bot problem was supposed to be fixed when elon took charge of the platform but it has instead been amplified also all content that you upload is used to train their ai regardless if you want it or not
the app is fine but my accounts get suspended constantly this app will work fine its just the employees at x enforcement of the tos is very biased still edit they still have a very left leaning bias once those people are finally let go from the company things will run more smoothly i honestly would like a refund for the premium product i paid for and was not able to fully utilize
overall its a good app but the people use it arent good racism gender wars and targeting individuals because of their religion nationalism language caste race is very normal and justified also people spread propaganda very easily on this app i know freedom of speech is important but death and rape threats are hate speech not freedom of speech please fix these issues
barely works anymore feed will freeze up even with a high quality internet connection closing the app and clearing the cache doesnt help at all ive switched to using it in browser
the app itself works but its so horrible navigating videos as itll freeze and the whole app crashes i like using x but the crashes and bugs need to be sorted out
app doesnt work nothing loads when the phone is charging this issue is common on many android phones with different manufacturers star for having this issue unfixed for months
cant reply with a picture videos take too long to load failed to send post error but it actually posted no way to stop another video from auto play after watching one half the time cant even retrieve new posts
musk has run this app into the ground constantly refreshes what im looking at gives me the same notification over and over more bots than people made the search function useless can buy a better hairline but not make a better app
still the most disappointing app the worst now suddenly i could not get into my acct had to authenticate again again even after un reinstalling it due to technical issue
great app but there is a problem that is a bit buggyeverytime i try to make an account but after loading for seconds it says something went wrong while making an accountplease try again later i tried so many times so pls fix this problem overall its a good social app
not sure if anyone else has this problem there is currently a bug where andorid user cant be a speaker in spaces i tried to clear the cache reinstall the app but nothing helped it has been like this for weeks already
the app performance is terrible timelines dont load and just continuously show a spinning icon regardless of connection type force quitting or clearing cache doesnt help ridiculous to have such poor performance
in the past few months this app has become unusable probably of the time you open it it doesnt show anything new this app has no ability to refresh it just freezes this app has become useless
screen input doesnt work to start new posts doesnt show keypad unless in landscape paste to begin a post does work or start as a survey then write post then delete survey option or enter any character in landscape then go back to portrait mode write post then delete start character
the new video player is the worst ive ever seen no way to quickly close the video like before swiping now starts another video who in their sane mind would want that i read a thread watch a video want to close it and read the thread further but no have tiktok experience instead edit unbelievable but they managed to make it even worse now it switches to the next video automatically without any way to turn it off amazing thats what everyone wants right
completely different app compared to a couple of years ago the premium features are not worth the money and the changes to the ui to accommodate these useless features makes navigating the app much more clunkier than it should be adding the highlights and articles tabs to the profile page makes reaching your media and likes tabs the tiniest bit of annoying enough that it gets you ticked off after a certain point
okay this is getting ridiculous after viewing a single tweet im then hit with at least ads in a row then trying to scroll through them all makes more appear and lags the phone then causing the video player to stop working entirely the player starts working again after an app restart but then i lose what i was reading unless i bookmark it because it refreshes immediately few seconds later the feed refreshes again loosing whatever i was reading when the app started again no way
the amount of times things dont load its so frustrating im forever closing and reopening the app trying to get it to work to the point where i will screenshot a post that didnt load just so i can search the handle again at a time when its working so i can see the post ive now realised after reading reviews that when my andriod phone is on charge things wont load but as of yesterday in videos now have a playback error and wont play elon really dropping the ball here
i think we need to improve a few more bugs in this app playback error this is really annoying when i try to watch a video it tells me theres a playback error i have to restart the app and lose my place in the video too many ads algorithm when i choose not interested in a post i still see similar posts its overwhelming to get the same information repeatedly so i have to click not interested every time i see a post with the same topic
recently added a feature that autoplays a new completely random video after the current one ends which is very annoying and usually leads to an ad inappropriate video playing after to make things worse the feature can not be turned off some users report the option to disable this being present on the video player however this does not appear for alot of users
the current version of this app sucks big time except this one none of the other media apps have any issue with loading content this app just gets stuck for long without ever refreshing or with media files photosvideos taking for ever to load its getting frustrating to use this app cut down on the useless features and get back to the basics trying to make it an allinone app doesnt seem to be working
recently i constantly get this spesific issue in certain hour whenever i want to use this app my wifi is not out of connection however this app keep loading over and over again been freezing a lot unable to refresh my timeline and feed and cant even change the image profile cleaning cache and even restart my phone in the hope for it to be normally accessible but nothings happening everything is fine with other apps except for this one this is the worst
i am unable to post a tweet with a photo or video the status after clicking on post is always sending but then it is never posted i can only post tweets that are purely text i am not sure if only paid accounts can post with photos or videos but i am sure that it isnt because of my internet connection fix this bug i have already done the basic troubleshooting such as clearing data and cache uninstallinginstalling then updating the app all are to no avail
loading loading loading the current version of this app sucks big time except this one none of the other media apps have any issue with loading content this app just gets stuck for long without ever refreshing or with media files photosvideos taking for ever to load its getting frustrating to use this app cut down on the useless features and get back to the basics trying to make it an allinone app doesnt seem to be working
used to be great surviving off the community it seems every second video gives me a playback error or struggles to work honestly have a better experience if i use the mobile browser pixel pro its weird that i could even entertain the possibility that there is a tier user experience for the system based on political opinions but realistically expect due to the huge cut of staff the result of changes elon implemented
ive been using various apps and websites without any issues but x has been a huge letdown despite having a fast and stable internet connection x consistently fails to load photos videos and tweets initially i thought the problem might be with my internet service provider but after confirming that everything else works smoothly its clear the issue lies with x itself
i used to love this app i could get all the science news i wanted for my condition follow authors and artists avoiding the news from the usa is i wanted now my for you page is full of nasty maga types borderline racists and cheerleaders for the republicans its gone downhill and i no longer log in regularly its very sad
this year ive noticed the app doesnt always load properly and i dont always know why i am certain however that you cant use the app whilst charging your device it simply doesnt load and yet after unplugging closing the app and relaunching it starts working again otherwise the app would function perfectly well
since the rebrand it lags refreshes shows the same tweets all day now my dms arent working can barely open a message certainly cant respond to the message without the app having a heart attack then force closes it gone awful
yeah this app barely works on my pixel now cant interact with tweets after having the app open for like minute have to close and reopen and of course the app refreshes so you just lose the tweet you wanted to replylook at replies to
really frustrated to have subscribed to a creators premium subscription however im unable to see the subscriberonly posts and being threatened the my subscription till be cancelled if i dont log into x to confirm it but ive logged in severely already thats money down the drain fix this please im losing my moneys worth
top stories and just want i need is hear ive been soo up to date w all the latest news i give because i click a funny thread the next thing theres bums everywhere so i wish the developing crew elon can make a setting where we can cut such content out thank you tho x for being that friend
the program has a very strange problem the app is completely not working while the phone charging no photos and videos available and cant update anything including timeline and anyone account please fix asap
you need to bring back seeing what people like on there profiles the likes section its how alot of us found interesting new stuff and people to follow it being gone has made it so much more difficult and boring seriously bring it back
getting rid of the block is just going to open the door for harassment update i just reported this app as suspicious because they are officially rolling out the new block its just a way for stalkers and predators to have easier access to victims trash site run by a trash person
images do not load except for ads even though they work on the browser the keyboard takes a solid seconds to open in the app how do you break the keyboard a million other bugs too
used to be fine but for a while the app hardly works often doesnt refresh even after restart struggles to load tweets and constantly unable to play media or if it does play it is buggy
twitter is now mostly ads for brands youve never seen before there are occasional surveys that will ask you if youve ever seenpurchased from insert a brand everyone is familiar with it doesnt make much sense to never run those more popular ads instead
i would rate it better if this app didnt have such unneccesary problems ive tried for over a year now to put in my age in my twitter account and i always get the same goddamn notification you need to be at least to change your birthdayage like seriously i tried it a few days after my th birthday contacted the support several times and got no answer whatsoever im fricking now and i still get that notification teach your app to fricking count ffs im an adult im not under
downloaded again after not uding for several weeks my account got suspended for no reason i try to submit an appeal it doesnt let me log into the appeal site i cant appeal ok fine but i cant use the site either as it doesnt allow me to see any post garbage
theres so many bugs with respect to the app hanging at a point that need to restart the mobile to make the app works and dont even let me start abouthe videos which keep getting stuck or gonon auto pause seriously needs to be fixed soon
edit and now theyve neutered the block function i guess its time to go elsewhere previous it was but now it crashes and locks up so often that i keep the force stop button open in the background
app works perfectly personally i havent had a single issue with it i do notice that all these negative reviews are popping up within the last couple of weeks theyre obviously fake and meant to do harm ive used the app daily for months without so much as an inconvenience
worst experience with x they are not cooperative spacially support i did two appeal but they close appeals with auto generated message they are not supporting their users if someone paying you then heshe has right to ask questions and you have to provide whatever users asking but here zero response i have cancelled my subscription because of their such disgusting behaviour dont waste your time and money i hope they will shutdown soon because companies run with users only
app crashes all the time especially videos the only thing that doesnt crash are their many ads their servers cant even supply tweets for sometimes minutes horrible
my account was hacked i tried to deactivate my account but would not let due apparently using the wrong password now i cant get into my account tried to reach out to support but got nothing so yeah thanks would things have been different under the old regime who knows
hate speech is rampant all throughout the app and isnt taken down after being reported as well as the amount of pornographic bots littering the replies and private dms a recent feature was that there isnt a proper block button to ensure user safety exposing content to blocked users and them being not able to engage is not enough the content shouldnt be visible at all to blocked users such improper block button should be illegal and the app should be taken off the play store
i keep getting sign out for no reason when i havent open the app for days i dont know why but are you really sure that this social app will became the most best social media platforms if this bug doesnt wan na be fixed tbh i like the old twitter but thanks to you elon musk you made us much more unhappier cuz of your ideas of the app if this bug or anything that we hate doesnt be fixed and changed then we change from xformally twitter to bluesky
deleted the app back in may and now that i downloaded again it keeps refreshing the feed randomly and theres no way to go back to the point of the timeline where i got interrupted i already looked into the settings and it doesnt seem to be caused by anything in particular its driving me crazy and makes me juste want to delete it again please fix this
feed auto refreshes randomly old content reappears the trend section no longer works and doesnt show local trends or tweets its basically turned into an ad filled sponsered hellscape with blocked and muted accountswords appearing on my feed and porn under all the hashtags overall its a mess i miss u little blue birdie fly high
too many ads three in a row every one or two posts and the fact one can purchase verification makes it hard to find out whos trustworthy very hostile environment
i never thought one day id give this app a bad review it has become the worst app to work with it doesnt play videos sometimes and doesnt load pics some times even loading tweets and refreshing the timeline doesnt work
you thinking about joining x dont they will be stealing your safety away from u with a broken useless update to blocking which allows those you block see your posts basically taking away the whole point of safety with blocking not a fan of ai well this aint the place for you because they will be removing the option to opt out of training ai with your posts art or not its stolen go to better services that value basic media safety and isnt ran by a total idiot with no common sense
removing the video clips from sports events while simultaneously using an auto reload on the thread for the game makes it impossible to work through the traffic to find information
images rarely if ever load properly the app is just full of empty rectangles im constantly getting followed and dms from bots no way to block inappropriate content or prevent harassment
right now there are many shortcomings in it and they need to be fixed like reducing the reach without any information and taking down the x handle only if there is a problem with any post or video without any information
the app is trying to get rid of a proper block button their new terms for blocking will allow a blocked user to continue to see your posts but not comment like reply etc this completely undermines the reason for a block button so that people can feel safe from stalkers harassment bullying etc all of which the app does nothing to actually fix no matter how many reports are filed against people harassing bullying or cyberstalking no action is ever taken overall an unsafe app
has gotten way worse since elon took over im tired of my feed being full of nothing but political issues because that what he wants us to see i want the site back where i could look at memes and post art without having to buy a subscription to have my posts be worth a damn use bluesky instead thanks
created an account on x and it was suspended the next day without explanation i hardly used it and theres no way to contact support since i cant access my account very frustrating experience poor customer service star
it has been increasingly unreliable glitching out and being unusable at random hours they keep shoving ads wherever you can even introducing new features meant to shove more ads in your face autoscroll is the worst feature ever the policy changes are the worst
i go here mostly for the political content there are some accounts i follow i really like i am glad elon musk bought twitter i was permanently suspended in january i was given no explanation maybe because i was a trumpsupporter i never did anything bad that i know of it was very unsettling they never gave me an explanation i started over with a new account i like it so far i think it is a great platform for free speech
im from pakistan using x in pakistan so difficult it show error sometimes it want are human verification and when i follow or more account on x it shows you reach to daily limit i request to x team to make some updates on these error
this app doesnt letting me in it automatically logout s my id and when i try to login it keep on fetching and it asks me to login again and again i have tried my clearing cache and reinstalled it but this time i uninstalled it
this app has altered the block feature in such a way that it no longer keeps what makes a block a block anyone thats been blocked on the site can still view your account making the block feature virtually useless this allows those who have been blocked to indirectly interact with the user thats blocked them
app crashes often even after updating it apps hostile environment is supported by the company i do not agree with the apps change in the block system which allowed blocked users see your content but not interact doesnt this go against play stores policies
overall good app what i dont care for is the lack of control over the timeline no response when you post to tweeter theres room for improvement update after a few years it seems obvious they dont take feedback seriously i see the same issues today with over hundred followers i find it interesting that i dont get interaction now as x there seems to be less suppression im guessing liberals are rating at star bc they dont like musk and are against free speech
im not sure if im the only one who experiences this but there are sudden moments where the app wont refresh itself and it may take a few hours for it to act normally again and it has nothing to do with my own internet connection as other apps would be working just fine while this is happening
twitter getting worse and worse since musk bought it nobody wants to see twitter become an app for everything also hate that ads play unmuted as default which shouldnt be the case the algorithm is absolutely horrible right now also more bots then ever before and a lot of scam ads now videos automatically skip to the next after watching what a great idea cant be deactivated on android even weeks after feature release music just keeps playing in the background sometimes
cant scroll down after a certain amount of posts which are very few by the way like i know there are more posts with the tag why is it that twitter wont let me scroll past a certain point seriously this is the only app ive experienced that does this
app barely ever works its been like this for a while now every minutes the app refuses to load and messages wont work its just the mobile version there has been zero effort to fix it address these issues
the block feature coming up soon firstly how dare this app decide to remove our only freedom of privacy from people we didnt want to see what weve been up to absolutely horrible there are hundreds if not thousands of harassers that will get an opportunity to get their way back in their victims lifes to stalk and track their every move in this platform the point of blocking people is to keep us safe however gatekeeping people from this feature that is only now required by money is bad
anytime im using the app by reading tweets and messages it automatically logs off and sometimes i get a notification saying that ive broke the rules which ive havent that makes me very annoyed
overrall experience is great however the app does experience a slowdown when being operated while charging it used not to happen but it happens so frequently these days i feel that this is not right at all
glitches left and right now you can add invasion of privacy to the mix the hits just keep on coming with what once was a fantastic app and platform
i will go straight to the point the app performance had gone from bad to worse if there was another word i could use i wouldnt use worse it lags takes forever to load and refreshes unnecessarily making it a pain to use there has been no improvement since it changed handsmanagement can we just have the simple basic twitter back without the unnecessary addons causing its performance issues
please i have started seeing ads on this app this is the first time this is happening since when did this app have ads its highly distracting one of the major reasons i loved this app is due to the lack of ads please and please take it off
its unbelievable how this website came crashing down the moment a certain someone bought twitter bots everywhere having an actual salary just by doing nothing which is still insane the overall application is a mess at this point people are gon na start turning this app into an orange youtube sooner or later mark my words overall shame on this website shame
this app has been acting strangely for the past couple of weeks in addition to this x genius team making it extremely difficult to update apps on an almost weekly basis apps frequently stop working and crash
its better since musk took over speech is definitely more free but i have to say the reporting system for abuse isnt very consistent and it would be good to have the option to edit posts even if it was a limited number day without having to pay to do it i would also like the option to dislike posts just for the craic if musk wants to put me on the payroll to sort out the abusive posters im at his disposal and i can do it from home
ui has a lot of performance issues content randomly stops loading video quality will fluctuate regardless of connection
genuinely nonfunctional since last update media completely stops loading about seconds after the app opens and i have to constantly force quit re open the app over and over again to load new posts completely functionless garbage elon has completely ruined this site
first they added a feature that autoplays random videos after the one you watch nonoptional now as of release for you refreshes after you view any post causing you to lose the post you were looking at and others that were shown before it refreshes nonoptional also got logged out randomly on both last two versions at least these features make me want to use the app less so ill call that a plus
i paused all updates for this god forsaken app back before the rebrand from twitter which is why im terribly upset that i now have to update it because it wont let me edit my profile at all absolute garbage i yearn for the old twitter days get bent elon edit twitter also keeps eating my drafts but only the ones on my main trash fire of an app thanks
doesnt even load anything most times i open it been like this for months and now it does not even give me all the notifications from people who i have all notis enabled on still doesnt even load the content most times when i open the app
crashes constantly uninstall and reinstall and it works for a week and then crashes again randomly turns off notifications bad app since last update now cant send pictures
for months now i can not go to any direct message pages without it crashing the app completely this along with so many other things makes this app near unusable
this app is just going downhill everyday earlier it used to be fun but nowadays glitches in everything like unable to play videos loading problem apart from that no action being taken for hate speeches racism has become a part of it i hope the x team addresses these issues soon
the new block update have made the site much more dangerous stalkers and harassers could still see messages of their target thoese people could still screenshot of their targets post about it and send their followets to harass them you can not feel fully safe without privating your account
cant even open my dms without crashing and restarting all over again plus i cant send any images it would made the app restart again please fix it you cant keep it worse than previous update
the other issue is still a problem but recently theyre changing the block function making it essentially useless this is ridiculous customer support is downright awful will suspended accounts out of nowhere for no reason and literally give no reason and then you appeal and you get the same exact automated bot message about how theyve reviewed for reinstatement when its impossible for any real person to have read the appeal and reviewed anything in such a short time
the app has been buggy as of recently every time i would scroll everything would appear blank as if its trying to load up but never did i dont k ow if this is an android phone thing or not but twitter has a consistent rabbit of crashing on android devices
too many ads now theyve made policy changes such that any post made whether media or text will be collected for ai training purposes there is no option to opt out aside from deleting your account
frequent bug that plays the audio of multiple videos at the same time whilst trying to watch one video the new bug is that videos keep pausing themselves so you have to keep unpausing them
this app has gotten so bad with elon acquiring it it has gotten so bad that it can literally heat my phone enough to make my palm red not only that but it almost impossible to use this app because of the lag it makes its filled to the brim with neonazis which yeah you can ignore but this app now features them like accounts you should follow imagine being new to this and the first thing after logging a new account is being recommended nazis like nothing also the captha is dogshit
i love that x is a space for free speech on other platforms you need to be careful with words used because of it being breached by social media guidelines x is where to get news that has no doubt behind it and is authentic not falsified by what the mainstream media are renowned to do x is a different vibe i never really was into x as i believed it was just another social media platform that was like the rest first time i have been proven wrong haha x is honestly refreshing
keeps crashing every two minutes this app is crashing can it worked on let us know maybe its not suitable for android or samsung specifically so we know
the new change to block makes this site dangerous hands down especially for women and thats not even touching on the fact that you cant opt out of using your posts for ai training deleting and never coming back
spam bots try to follow me everyday and reporting them doesnt seem to help the block function is also useless now at protecting my privacy which is important given the number of malicious actors evidenced by the rampant spam that is on the platform since block still allows the blocked account to view my content
the app sometimes has a bug or two but worth living with they are always tweaking the change to the block function was a great move users can choose not to interact with other accounts but those accounts can still see content you want to hate on people they will know about it very fair
block feature doesnt work anymore anything you post will be used to train ai and the overall algorithm has been exclusively designed to show you nothing but hate shock posts including gore violence and hate crimes and anger inducing content app has been used as a platform to spread hate and misinformation because of the loser who purchased and ruined it
mobile app keeps crashing and going to blank screens everytime i click a post never had this problem before its so annoying
absolutely horrendous the app crashes every other second when i try to message my friends it lags like crazy sometimes ill try to view older messages and a whole section of them disappears and all i see are messages from like three months ago also the new feature of automatically playing another random video at the end of the one im watching is so infuriating too many adds and irrelevant contents the feed refreshes too often and randomly
well i was loving it for days until it decided i must be verified and says my email belongs to another account i set it up on this phone and only have one account need help i do not want to risk losing everything in there i wrote to the support email address above and hope i get a response
constantly doesnt work or refresh my feed sometimes it wont play videos or let me tweet or comment half the time i dont get notifications for comments on my posts this app has turned awful the last year or so
twitter doesnt stop crashing you can try to uninstall or clear cache it still constantly crashes its unusable still happening
someone misunderstood my tweets then sent someone to kill me twitter must make sure noone can ever use any of my information to find me my guess is that the ip address was used to try to kill me please do something about that or i will spread the word about the dangers of using x this is a true story i was not able to call because i was in a country in which police dont speak my language this is something only the techcompanies can solve techcompanies will benefit if they solv
elon really said wait lem me make it worse i hate this platform unless youre already popular or randomly go viral youre stuck in the elo hell of social media the app is designed to thrive on negativity its turned into a vehicle for elon to spam political garbage most recently weve made it so even if you block someone they can still see your post if its public uploading content gives them free reign to do whatever thankfully most of the creators i follow have switched to bluesky
of the time the app just doesnt load the feed just keeps on refreshing the problem is fixed by restarting my phone but it doesnt make sense for me to always restart my phone just for one app
extremely toxic like holy hell lots of negativity and the app is flooded with rage and misinformation i got ta be honest im kind of surprised that people are still even using it even nextdoor has a way to report misinformation x doesnt overall a very negative experience cheers
this app performance is so bad images takes forever to load videos are even worse it is very inconsistent and frustrating to use i have no issue with my internet as other apps performed okay
paid for premium basic so i could edit posts and it doesnt work waste of my money if this app really wants to hide such basic and essential feature such as editing behind a paywall at least make it functional
artists move to bluesky screw you and your dumb tos imagining forcing people to have their works used for ai imagine a block button thats absolute useless folks thats what twitter is ever since that dumb logo changed the link for twitter got mistaken for a site too moderation has never been so bad delete twitter and go to bluesky its way better
its pretty much a cesspool of hatred racism and somehow xxx videos the community notes help with all the lies being posted but no way to keep up with the amount they are apparently planning to get rid of the block option to some extent so that will make things worse had a good run but im out
has been in steady decline since it was changed over almost unusable of the time just stuck in a constant refresh loop that never ends how does it keep getting worse
the app tries too hard to monetize sells blue tick if you dont click ads youre shadow banned too exploitive the app sells to see your own feedback whos liking your posts if i could rate this app zero stars youll get locked out for contacting a follower in seconds worst app ever
normally i wouldnt give a bad review but i shouldnt be having this problem right now and am hoping to resolve it i keep getting the error unable to complete request whenever i try to sign into my google account but it works on my moto z fine its just slow but wont sign me in here idk if its an app issue or my phone so thats why its two please help i will improve review if so edit they fixed it
if you want curated rage bait filtered between layers of ads then this is your app used to be called twitter now it is a letter of the alphabet want to leave them feedback too bad that page just refreshes the help page dark mode is nice app is just another echo chamber generation system how can it recommend trends and users i have blocked wish elon would put all his efforts into leaving earth instead of ruining it
the app has a lot of bugs and majority of the time images are not loading or videos or not playing and it gets very annoying trying to look at an account or pictures but the pictures dont load and take a very long time just to load in
im having a very bad experience with the app since quite some time now as the app has some bug in the dm section everytime i want to rp it crashes n brings me to the home page i mean i simple cant rp to anyone in my dms without getting kicked out a few times this is my x app version release phone model xiaomi lite ne g os version ukoinxm itll be very helpful if u can fix this or threads is really taking over youll
i dont know what happened but the images videos and tweets are loading extremely slow i have stable internet connection and also love using this app but last few days have been pretty bad
the app keeps loading for close to hours sometimes im unable to use the app it just keeps loading also i get a lot of playback error for videos so videos cant play its never been like this before
i really love using twitter but for last few days this app is not working properly images and videos are not showing properly my feeds are not updating properly i request you to solve this problem i cant go on without using twitter
currently unstable and refuses to operate correctly on some samsung phones it allows you to log into the website but using the app all it does is go back to the login prompt with the correct credentials entered as such theres a major bug they have not fixed this in over years
elon has ruined this app he wants it to be the town square and apolitical but is constantly banning accounts biasedly and promoting far right political content it is inundated with bots many of them promoting adult services i made a second account recently and the entire for you page was shirtless women the app also runs far worse and has lost many of its amazing features that he has removed in place of adding a rather awful ai and hiding likes
this is the second time ive gotten my account suspended with no reason or response from x i never posted or commented anything either time honestly the app is very buggy inconsistent and filled with bots
installed the app tried logging in keeps loading and after minutes a message pops up that something isnt right try later same when i tried to create account tried this multiple times but nothing changes
im getting tired of this app whenever your account is in shadow ban there is no recipe to set your account free from shadow ban the only choice is to deactivate the account and open a new one my account has been in shadow ban for some time now and i have more than k followers i deleted my posts logged out of the account for more than a month when i returned i was still facing the same issue pls fix this and always find ways to set our accounts free from shadow ban its frustrating
constant issues loading up data other apps work fine browsers load up pages x always fails to load up post and info as if im getting no service but other apps load up fine this is a constant issue
as much as i loved using this app it is just its not the same anymore i still will use it to talk to some people but when elon started making all these changes it ruined an app that was good also naming it x is a huge mistake taking away blocking is a major security risk with twitter x attempt at reducing the capabilities of the block function this action violates play store store tos increases likelihood of safety violations on xs platform
not only does this constantly not work load timeline likes comments now the new block feature that doesnt block is live the way that this app has gone down the drain is incredible this feels like it should be illegal
the latest update keeps not responding and having to be restarted also it has recently started using too much battery in the background
please fix playback errornot loading and image loading errornot loading its getting worse and worse not just on this app on web browser too too much ads backtoback ads post together instead of one ad post ads shown each time when scrolling down one video auto scroll down when video ends endless bots rampant etc so many bugs and glitches and unwanted features
ive had it twice now just randomly log me out and refuse to log me back in until i uninstall and reinstall the app also the content you see settings just didnt work one day trash app with a trash owner
hangs almost all the time becomes unreliable especially when charging your phone playback error almost all the time and generally doesnt work well still a good app though fix those bugs
the recent update has ruined the whole texting option i cant type a normal message without waiting to see as the letters catch up on screen with what i have already typed out sending messages and pictures bugs out the dm so much the same way
awful there are far too many bots on it to the point i feel a mass bot purge is necessary i had to set my account to private and even that doesnt deter them from trying and it makes me worried that im at risk of getting my account hacked theres glitches and the recent updates now implemented just downright feels illegal
this app is less than adequate to say the least constant app crashing and wont load for hours at a time tons of propaganda too
the ads are getting worse with every update auto plays every video into an obnoxious ad and if you try to scroll past it the screen goes back to it again so annoying to use
was still cant add phone number the error respond not helping and once i could input the phone carrier not found now and now the ads level is so lovely rows of ad most of the time you wasted one screen just to see post regularly got log out aftet update and after log in back again most of the time followering kicks in good job
it should stop refreshing the feed automatically only when we do it add an option to organize the bookmarks the algorithm should work better with not allowing posts when we dont want it and should be more rigid with hate speech tweets
this app is great after all but the problem is the limit of when stalking or checking someone following i have an old account which im trying to stalk with my other acc that i forgot my password on following but since it have like followings it wont show all the followings
i cant play videos i thought im experiencing internet connection but no the problem is with the app itself that cant play videos not to mention hard to show images too the whole app is broken in my opinion
the app functionally is ok pretty slow and overloaded with temu ads the bigger issue is the re tooled algorithm that does its best to cram elon and trump into your feed and also allows the most hateful language and rhetoric ive seen since xbox live in the cod days its atrocious unless you hate everyone thats not straight and white im straight and white and it still makes me want to vomit its basically a far right and uber maga propaganda app at this point
has absolutely gone down the drain since ownership transitioned forcing all users to comply to sharing your data with its ai because too many opted out and now the block function is being removed and the amount of ads has tripled but none of them are anything other than scams as most advertisers fled early on
every to vids a bloody temu ad pops up i loved this up untill about a month ago the advertising now is horrible im uninstalling because of it thers other issues but they dont bother me like the ads i hate temu so much now because this app
horrible app i tried to reopen my account and it asks for my password or user name i dont remember i put my email address it says already used then i get a message saying i was sent an email for a code number how can i check my email if im using my phone while using my phone i installed the x app too frustrating
app has lost most of the features that made it good ads for the worst stuff constantly being shoved down your throat especially sports betting
stopped using it uses too much data even with data saver on in settings prior to september used to use or gb month since then despite spending considerably less time on the app it uses more than gb month
almost immediately after elon assumed control my feed has become a steady stream of racial slurs and hate i dont even follow any of these people and theyre still populating my timeline if i were an advertiser i would want nothing to do with this app as it currently stands update months later elon is destroying everything another update elon has made the app incredibly unsafe by removing the block feature and exposing vulnerable people to stalkers and worse
this app sucks my biggest complaint is that twitter app not calling it x never loads and the server is always down going on a computer or mobile website works fine but thats makes the app itself inconvenient and useless
the app is borderline unusable half the time dms and timeline wont update ads are atrocious and continue to show even if you mark the app an agenda has been pushed
worse than it used to be block feature will be under a pay wall which isnt normal as its a safety tool and also not working for the google store rule but most probably the eu laws as well content is more garbage than ever and its pushing weird content as ads its just trash now that the ownership is to someone whos not mature enough
too many functional lags affecting voice notes media files loading where do i start with my experience using the app wanton race baiting unchecked flow of misinformation to garner reactionscommunity notes can only do so much people i mute still showing up on my feed inadvertent refreshing of my feed page terribly disrupting my interaction with the content the app is a lot worse than it has ever been i keep taking more and more breaks from the app hoping to not return at some poin
with the changes to the block feature no longer preventing blocked from seeing tweets actively putting minors more at risk of seeing content along with harassersstalkers more active on the platform since muskrat took control if your privacy is a concern to you and it should be bluesky is the much better alternative
recent update causes the app to show playback error often when viewing videos there is no option to turn off automatically show next video ads post also bug out causing it to show around to posts consecutively instead of showing every other times also for some weird reason x doesnt work while charging the phone been like this for a long time already
ive been using twitter for a while now and after elon decided to take away the block feature im switching to bluesky for my own safety people have stalked me and sent me death threats on there and i know once that the block feature is removed it will increase again please remove this app because it currently violates google plays tos
some misinformation but really all of it is vetted through community notes and its hard to get anything by that is misinformation without it being challenged not too shabby way better then reddit i do got ta say though a daily scroll can be pretty depressing i wish people would be nicer to each other yet what can i do except be one more voice among many they have good options to pay for more outreach but it seems like a waste of money unless you are willing to work the app hard
the app does not work while charger cable is plugged in im constantly having to force stop the app and open again for it to refresh the feed or to see notifications too many advertised tweets even after muting fix it
been loving x ever since elon took over it runs so much better than it ever has its actually the reason i came back to twitter as i shut my previous account in due to it being an insufferable far left echo chamber now its the most unbiased town square ive been in x has become the number place in the world for transparency and my experience has been mostly positive very glad to be back
very good app but the video player part should be improved it need a history of watched videos with the timestamps of pause the full screen mode of live vidoeos cuts significant parts of the video
i created my profile around in and havent used this much but now i tried to download it and i see load of cripto spams there and account is suspended i guess but i cant reach to coustomer care to restore my account but this app is just is lame and i dont think they want to restore my account can post ss if you like
i cant even change my profile pictures in app anymore i have to go to websites or my pc to change it so laggy and ads every scroll i go cant even scroll on posts as we also do before this became a business app instead of a casual chill app
does not have a viable block feature like it was supposed to and did before additionally there are frequent crashes multitudes more ads and spam than before and heavy censorship
constant bugs and bots everywhere blue checkmark means nothing except having money and the worst opinions now youre not even allowed to block someone from stalking or harassing you since the black feature no longer works
i have to resign into my account every single time i want to enter the app im also having an issue now where it wont even let me sign into my account it just keeps kicking me out if i could id rate this app stars
i like a lot of the content but what i like most is that the investors seem to believe in free speech and thats very important in my opinion to everyone i guess i just believe that everyone just needs someone to listen to whats important to them because thats just showing basic respect as humans we all need that i personally like the app
app keeps on crashing about a week now cleared app cache and data did not work x sent an update worked for less than a day back to craahing app again thats on top of always being kicked out of the chat box
i like x except there are a lot of scammers claiming they are elon musk asking for money through apple cards some saying its for the purchase of fan cards or its because i won money and a new tesla vehicle i dont like the change to the block feature ive had stockers before law enforcement had to get involved the change does not protect me it puts me out there please up security
twitter is so broken i have clicked not interested on an ad well over times and that is still the only ad i get and i have gotten japanese tweets in a row on my timeline despite never interacting with a single japanese account i keep getting japanese tweets why does it think i speak japanese
live updates dont work tried multiple times and keeps saying trying to update check back later if i check back later then its not a live update dont use the app for sports updates its useless
great app for objective news information and free speech entertainment best way to keep current in my opinion but it does depend on who you follow just like every other media app
the app and website continuously get worse for users bots running rampant the upcoming change forcing users into allowing our data and content to be scraped for ai and the block feature that wont actually block people who intend harm from viewing your posts are all examples of how unfriendly its become
i got rid of my tv since it was chained to a bundle of visual channels and data that i didnt want but was forced to pay in order to watch a few shows i enjoyed twitter now x enables me to select the people who can inform good or bad opinions educate and interact to flush out evil and support common sense for the good fortunately twitter is no more i feel freer to bundle filter or select views and make comments
all the newer fivestar reviews are too blinded by political opinions to say anything genuine about the app as a longtime twitter user i can confidently say the platform has progressively gotten worse since elons acquisition and there is no reason to have a twitter account anymore with other competing apps serving the same purpose and doing it significantly better
literally useless on android first of all it doesnt get some of the features the website and ios are getting second terribly buggy sometimes posts with media attached dont send at all the app crashes constantly and sometimes doesnt load anything third ever since elon allowed free speech this app has just been a place for conservatives to spread transphobia its sad to see how bad twitter has gotten since elon came over
although im not a big fan of its algorithm that flags you as spam for liking following or posting too quickly or if your content doesnt conform to a narrow expectation i still believe twitterx is a great platform early on i was labeled a spammer despite never spamming which may have hurt my credibility for simply liking diverse content but this no longer affects me the platform still supports free expression and i hope it stays that way
the block button allows people you block to see your post last i checked that is not how a block button is supposed to work edit correction now it works as stated above i still dont think thats how a block button is supposed to work
almost everyday at early morning this app just doesnt load its not my connection or that i need to update the app it just doesnt work tooooooo many bots with spam of the side you guys already know this app is worse than before
update this platform is breaking tos violation of user privacy so its already a spammyscammy platform at this point the notifs badge on app on my phone wont go away even though ive checked it over and over it only goes away when i check it on my desktop computer
since theyre about to update the app to where blocked people can still see your posts im not going to be using this app much longer its a pointless update thar theyre rolling our for no reason and it defeats the purpose of even blocking people in the first place i swear ever since musk took over twitter and yes im still calling it twitter it has just been going downhill the app sucks now and frankly im just gon na head over to bluesky
it is so hard to watch most of the videos as they keep halting every few seconds very exasperating experience
ive had zero technical issues with the app none nada zilch and absolutely appreciate the dedication to free speech and transparency other social platforms should follow suit only thing i would improve is a better way to track my history so i can return more easily to discussions
i cant get into my original account tried creating a new one says i have to many accounts under my phone ive been blockedsuspended for reasons i dont understandthis all happened before elon took over and i ve tried to dispute it with no resolutionanswer can anyone of the mods help me out with this been trying for yearsjust want my original account restored thats all im asking and i cant get anyone to help me can someone please get back to me to straighten this out plz
used to be great despite its problems elon ran it to the ground and now its barely functional every update makes it worse they just announced a change to the block function that makes it practically useless app is mostly bots nazis and nazi bots now shameful destruction of a longloved social media platform
ok i get blue check marks but i only keep seeing the only fans accounts getting into the top and it is just annoying at this point why is the app so laggy now while the website isnt i am using the website on the phone and it runs fine while the app just doesnt work at times
im still trying to figure out how x itself works so used to fascistbook messenger x is a lot different especially when i am trying to figure out how to message my peeps personally and not post the for our eyes only messages to their page otherwise i am glad that fascistbook permanently suspended my th account with them
the latest update making it even worse cant even watch video without lag keeps refreshing the timeline but still no response sometimes i thought my wifi is the problem but nopeother socmed working just fine do better
the app just doesnt work constantly broke cant type a sentence without crashing full of terrible ads pushing extremist politics worst app ive ever used
its a good app the best app for news of all sorts but i wish there were more features like the ability to see users top or most viewed posts and i dont like how no matter what i do i get random followers and i have to block then i have created new accounts but that didnt help at all
constantly crashes uses all my battery and destroys my whole phone performance no other app does this today it has logged me out and ive had to log in every time i open the app so disappointing
not only does it function badly this app is just a cesspit of misinformation and extremism you literally cant be on the app without it trying to feed you space x tesla or musk tweets along with people telling you to kys every day moving to bluesky
for the last few weeks phone app refuses to refresh iv tried uninstalling reinstalling force stop and restarting mobile but nothing works the app used to be good but not now its literally useless
creator subscription application is not yet reviewed searching in our own profile is not giving correct search results we need creator premium subscription price adjustment in rupees new posts old posts in profile are not in order this glitch comes many times and in thread posts also something glitch is there
used to really enjoy twitter then it became x and the massive influx of bot accounts and bigotry came pouring in ad after ad along with posts from users ive never interacted with blocked users can now see the posts from those that have blocked them continues to decline and turn into truth social deleted my account and moved to blusky now all is right in the world again
the quality of this app drops every month there are now several privacy issues that have arisen as well as an ineffective algorithm i can not recommend it and have begun to look into alternatives
the app was good months back now its lagging most of the time while playing the videos it is getting stuck at tapping the play button twice starts the video again
the app keeps crashing every day showing a can not retrieve posts at this time message seems updates are useless and it becomes more frustrating to try to go on the app
yall really butchered this app lmfao cant view likes new videos play right after current ones cant use the app while charging my phone block is changing soon that whole free speech do what you want slogan when elon was buying twitter sounded nice you know before making it the most bland unstable social media app in existence how you mess up worse than facebook is wild yall should feel embarrassed dud after dud updates not one good update since twitter became x
how is it lagging every days now have to manually delete caches if it ever reaches mb cant even see my timeline without bloody ads bullocks algorithm ive delete caches ive updated and still the latest post i could see is one from days ago how is it even worse now than ever
posts arent loading sometimes and constant scam ads keeps autoplaying loud ads after watching a second meme video with no option to just watch videopost dms and searches are spotty not working half the time
very worst experience i have with this app everytime i browse thought the app and app randomly crash at any point of time then i have to wait for hours then only i can able to use the app
x has turned out to be a very useless app since elon musk bought it elon musk says its an app for free speech but he selects the people he wants to pay huge based on the club they are into and those people will be sharing the screenshots of big payouts to attract many people to subscribe to premium not knowing you cant even earn that kind of amount of youre not selected by elon musk hes clown for making this app like this
was on this app for years and seeing it go down hill so fast in the past two has been sad the search function for dms hasnt worked for months now there are times when the app straight up doesnt want to load they keep removing useful features for no reasons like circles and the block feature so stalkers creeps and insecure billionaires can access your account even if you dont want them to the apps new management have extremely biased politics and pushes that onto all its users
this is kinda annoying when i try to find a video to upload it only shows photos when i try to upload it thru other means like file manager gallery and etc please make it that both videos and photos can be selected thanks
the actual app is worse than just looking at x on google chrome it refreshes constantly even while youre reading something is it so hard to make it so that the app does not refresh unless i pull down from the top
x has improved steadily since the twitter days choose who to follow and experience a rich curated feed the way you like it stay up to date with citizen journalism pay for premium it is well worth it
this has become a right wing propaganda machine wouldnt recommend unless youre into that also the ads are stupid and repetitive probably due to lack of corporate sponsors this is the new truth social try bluesky instead
i purchased premium subscription it hasnt been activated for days app keeps telling me im not subscribed i should upgrade to premium even their contact support requires you to buy premium to message them on top of that app is filled with bugs glitches
video player keeps getting stucknot playing properly every useful feature is getting removed or put behind a paywall update sept literally can not send a single message in dms without the app lagging and crashing absoute junk
app rarely refreshs i open it up and if anything does show other than the logo its the last post i viewed but incomplete if it is an image it doesnt load try to interact and nothing happens the only way to get a refresh is to restart my phone not ideal for any social media and even that only temporarily works if there was an option for a zerostar review id use it
theres a problem with this app its constantly loading over and over again i cant even refresh my feed or interact with it i dont know what you guys doing in the hq because the bug is still there good job guys its getting worse
app is so bugged for android user dk about the ios ones you play a video scroll down the audio from previous video keeps on playing and mixes with the new video now you have no idea whether it was on for you section or following section another bug is it refreshes automatically when youre trying to watch something so friggin annoying and takes you ages to find that video kindly fix it
android version has become terrible in the last few months there are times where nothing in my feed loads and you have to click on videos like times now before they start playing
if you scroll to watch a video after that moving to next video both st audio plays along with nd video fix that bug irritating
uses too much battery and heats up screen non local newscountry specific trending eg entertainment news etc l request you to please fix it thank you
im back as of nov i took a break from twitterits and my posts still arent getting off the ground smaller accounts appear to have algorithm issues while the larger accounts are boosting and reposting in the dm application and are controlling x how can x improve make x userfriendly for smaller accounts in spite of these issues i have to give x a elon has brought back free speech and played a huge role in preserving free and fair elections thank you elon
hands down the most hateful racism filled content app ever new features make this app horrible but the people and things they allow are worse ads under every post that have nothing to do with the original post and bots that will follow yourandoms harassing you for not liking their opinion new feature will allow people on your block list to still see your posts etc i respect elon to an extent he destroyed this app
do not download this app it is a major privacy breach recently changes to the tos and privacy policy have made it to where you can not opt out of having your tweets and photos being used for ai which is a major privacy breach and now blocking has been reduced to nothing but stalking as people i have blocked can now just see my tweets screenshot them and start drama against me get bluesky instead it values privacy and safety and isnt run by a farright businessman
update true blocking is a paid feature no privacy unless you severely limit your account via a lock they took away functional blocking trolls and stalkers are currently allowed to access our accounts not to mention forced autoscrolling on videos randomly refreshing the feed stuck notifications and all the bots artificially inflating your follower count usually sporting a link to adult sites very bad move given theres minors
twitter is a fastpaced platform for realtime updates trending news and brief interactions its great for staying informed and networking but can be polarizing due to moderation and algorithm changes simple to use but limits deep discussionsit is witter not x
so buggy app freezes sending messages pictures and videos dont load anymore i normally dont leave bad reviews but this needs to be fixed sooner rather than later
the current features of this app are not responsive its having issues with slow down and screen freeze x needs to improve the customer interface
the moment it changed from twitter to x every single aspect of this app took an immediate nosedive in quality and functionality and it seems to just continue to spiral downward sad
unstable filled with porn bots crypto scams and pushing political agenda since the rework into x it has become an increasing disaster and i wager of the positive reviews are paid for or botted heck i might give it another star if it would let me finish a dm without crashing incredibly incompetent platform management
temu ad after temu ad after temu ad how many times do i have to tell you i dont like this ad before you stop showing me the same same temu ad every posts videos freeze pictures dont load what is this grok rubbish more premium nonse features app has become total trash since that egomaniac took over
its a good app these days as the western world is on collapse currently this app is good because you actually have freedom to say whatever is on your mind which is something that instagram and threads are activity trying to remove currently this is the better app
""
show more on chats not working rather opening chat on new page good app but most features are available on premium like simply editing what you have already sent you cant for free
impossible to sign up i get through authentication just fine but afterwards it keeps taking me back to beginning of signup ill try another day or forget it altogether
politics aside if youre going to buy an app dont ruin it ever since elon bought this app i constantly have issues like logging me out mid session crashing or random error messages out of nowhere
significantly worse media barely loads the app doesnt work if im charging my phone its slower clunkier and the block feature no longer works as it should do
videos have an auto scroll function that im not able to disable some users have this option but its not available to me this app constantly rolls out new features that are either broken inconvenient or contrary to the way it has always worked before constantly confusing or changing the way youre used to using it there are no ways to get around this or change it its also full of bots and engagement farming accounts spamming the replies of every post which ruins any discussion
yes its usa product yes it has freedom of speech and to express your self blablablabut it doesnt mean as single rules for user in many countriesnow it gives freedom to express porn gambling and hate speech and less chance any tweet by user report will be taken down and still many bots account for sure i have deleted all my tweets and my account is more than years and its blankjust open x day to see whats trending in my country and close it less than minutes
in other problem officials anyone who brought the idea of making a video needs to be dismissed automatically and then check their heads the mindboggling thing was pushed without an alternative to deactivate it this app has been running for years since the year but this is the last straw bir is so incredible to be involved with any kind of video content
there are countless problems with this app especially this app crashes repeatedly app gets very slow when messaging someone doesnt show real time feed if this is the case with such a famous companys app then we users understand very well how unprofessional you are
x offers premium options none of which actually boost your audience so thats a scam also you cant use the app while you charge your phone your feed wont reshresh
meh every few hours i open the app it shows the same tweets ive seen the whole day ugh they keep showing pervertrd ads eventhough i click i dont like this ad everytime but still showing the same ad tf
since it has became x this has become the worse app barely functional nothing loads always crashes become more like tik tok algorithm is very manipulated to show you certain posts
they dont know their consumers and priorities every update is absurd and just keep hurting their revenue thanks to a single idiot that runs it every user has to suffer from their tantrums they are so invasive and out of touch when it comes to privacy that they cant do the block feature nor posting to function as intended additionally their video bandwidth sucks
lately app works horrible pictures and videos doesnt load most of the time and interface is so slow its literally unusable x just keeps going downhill great job elon
used to be ok but moderation now non existent doesnt seem safe since blocking broken plus so many technical issues with media payback and feed loading
twitter is revoking the block ability so people you block will still show up on your page you just cant interact with the post this is so asinine if i dont want to see content i block and move on revoking my blocking ability is tanking the user experience and im def looking to move to a more user welcoming app like blue sky
please make the videos pauseable with a tap on them that tiny pause button is ok for some but anyone with a tremor will find it almost impossible to stop a video
great app with freedom of speech unlike other biased totalitarian apps my only complaint is that it should not allow porn accounts i think that is not freedom of speech
crashes obnoxiously doesnt run smoothly the auto play of videos is dumb and always exclusively loads ads that also make the app crash crppy app that gets worse every update
ever since elon the idiot has made the purchase and renamed twitter to x this social media platform continues to become dysfunctional and receiving featureschanges that get implemented despite nobody agreeing to these changes and additions just like today they are changing the function of blocking to pretty much be another mute feature with the big difference being the blocked users able to see your postsbut not able to interact which makes it good for stalkers and harrasers
with every update the app gets less functional and makes changes directly against what a proper social media app should do the most recent change of a block no longer functioning as a proper block needs to be reverted
my app kept loading inexplicably i thought it was down but when i opened it via the website nothing happened i thought it was because my connection was not good but even when i have a good connection its still same then there are also certain hours more often midnight the app suddenly couldnt load anything and wouldnt update my timeline please fix this issue immediately
it stops loading the newer postseven for day old posts it doesnt load their comment or content i am surprised that this is even an issue for x as it defeats the point of being on x for users
click on create account just says something went wrong no technical support with error code to debug modern american sheep follow the herd everyone else can get rid of call centers company points of contact take away any assistance with fixing or even reporting problems and we will do it too ugh
i paid for premium and my features are still not available over weeks now xsupport doesnt have a way to reach out except their dmwhich sends you to a forum that says contact x support horrible customer support my account is also being throttled
the gradual degradation of twitters basic functions has made a once useful app a crash prone mess seems most common during video playback but can occasionally struggle to load anything
intuitive with a lot of options twitter has one of the best apps around its design is clear and well put together as well as seemingly optimized for speed i cant think of any negative aspects of this app aside from the fact that it is not open source
links open inside the browser of the time instead of the actual app the settings are set to open all supported links inapp but it does not work used to work pre but now its a broken mess this has not been fixed in years now
currently i am having trouble on the app once i open it for couple of minutes and its back to my home screen it happen several times i dont know what happen playback error all the time and having trouble in terms of the dms as well
trying to upgrade from the basic tier on android but when i navigate to the screen it takes me to explore premium and wont let me change my subscription tier
too many disgusting ads even ive pressed the i dont like this ads many times but its still appeared pls fix the app and remove that disgusting ads its makes me uncomfortable for use x
im new to this wonderful app so im still learning how to navigate through it so far im wondering why i took so long to subscribe but then i never subscribed to the old twitter dodged a bullet there thank you elon musk for using your wealth to do good for the world buying twitter and opening it up to be the epitome of free speech is truly the way to save the world enkosi
it is really enjoyable but always despite having best internet connection it take lots of time to recover load photo and video even news message is also not able to reload lots buffering even updated still this is happening which is irritating pls clear this thing
recently the timeline refresh doesnt work had to reopen and close the apps several times cleaned up ram etc but still stuck
i love it but idk what i did wrong that it told me something about some label was put temporary i believe on my profile after that notification it made all the people i followed say but they were still there i went to look for the label but do not see anything i deleted a couple posts that may be the reason but honestly i dont see anything wrong with what ive posted maybe it was a glitch i created an x account the same day elon went to the trump rally and i love his enthusiasm
love the app from what is used to be its more professional and clean than all the rest like book face also im a amateur radio skywarn station aprs with the ime bot weather updates are life saving aprs is integrated into x in the last few weeks of the time of this review book face has sensored life saving information we as hams share to the public independent fact checkers says it faults information for myself that was the indicator to leave it behind station knplr saying s
worked great until last week on my android constantly crashing telling me to clear cache this week it is asking me to sign in many times a day i exit then click the app and im in in messages crash and boots me out
they changed the concept of block feature people who got blocked by us can still see our profiles and even save our pictures this app is enabling creeps and freaks
x is a very good app for information dissemination and getting the latest news lately though i keep getting logged out and getting to do some arkose to verify my account this leads to loss of data and it can be really frustrating please look into this and others complaints that have been laid the bugs are way too much
block exist but doesnt function as it should be the new term and condition is harming creative aspect of it not even giving us to decline some of term that clearly is not profitable for user the new block system giving stalker a free real estatale making personal space even more questionable if they said that privating acc is a solution no its not its a social media for a reason
twitter is a twotiered society where people with nothing of value to say pay to play and get preferential treatment rendering the entire platform a waste of time people who pay for blue check marks dont have anything to say but they get all the exposure with their vapid statements burying actual valuable content of the time elon does not understand online ecosystems also the autoplay always shows me violence i dont trust auto play on twitter
app has gone down the drain it constantly freezes wont load or glitches i try force closing and even clear the cache when it was twitter it didnt have this many issues
after last two updates media is not playing properly either it doesnt start or pause after seconds even with high speed network and all other apps are working fine
regularly wont load timeline media playback constantly failing app is barely usable most of the time also service is flooded with nazis and the owner is the worst of them all would not recommend to anyone
it wont let me sign up i get all my info in and then its nothing but errors and takes me back to the signup page still gives green check marks through sign up and then gives me sign up can not be completed
not only it has become unusable but has go has far as violate the policy of privacy by making the block button into an useless option not a one good thing coming from any of its updates which is very sad for such necessary app as x is
as an artist the current state of twitter is disheartening the platform once a vibrant space for creative expression and community building has become overcrowded with ads and noise making it difficult to share work and connect authentically with fans the algorithm often buries original content favoring sensationalism over genuine artistry which feels discouraging when trying to showcase new pieces
iam excited and contented with the features and everything offered in the app except the monthly subscription for african countries its funny how subscription for premium in uganda is for the app yet for usa and eu the price drops this sucks elon should consider equalizing such big ups to the x team emmaafoyo
app has a bug that makes it usable for me random loaded videos will get stuck playing their audio over the current video im trying to view until i resetit is frustrating as hell
this application is heading towards being unfriendly with lowend smartphones and some midrange smartphones and always takes up unique connection ports connection management in extraordinary third world countries still cant handle it
best sm app for current events great way to find people i find out things here minutes after they happen my curated feed keeps me updated on all happenings for my political religious interests plus ive met wonderful like minded people who have become friends in real life i know of at least happy couples who found each other on this app i love that its more logical discussion not selfiespinterest level brag photos
temu ads everywhereevery second tweet used to be a useful app but now only use x on desktop because of temu ads tried everything possible to block them complained to x but no change now deleting from my phone as temu ads have made the app unusable
im grateful that x supports free speech something that shouldnt even be in question in the united states of america but was under twitters tenure thank you elon x now has more features than i even have time to try out im happy with everything i have tried btw now using motorola edge didnt see a way to update review for that
festering cesspool of disinformation racists and so much more dont bother oh for other tech based problems the app wont even refresh your timeline unless you unplug your device theres that too
the recent update has significantly degraded the user experience on this app unlike other media apps it often gets stuck without refreshing or takes an excessive amount of time to load photos and videos its becoming increasingly frustrating to use please focus on improving the core functionality rather than adding unnecessary features making it an allinone app doesnt seem to be effective
ever since the recent announcement about block buttons changing i cant see myself giving this app anything more than star the whole reason the block button exists is so that you block people who you dont want knowing that you exist and this update makes it way easier for stalkers to bother large creators
app is not working properly stucks the screen taking longer than usual to respond uninstalled and reinstalled twiceany one can help or i think i should use my account through browser x should take care why the app is not working properly stucks and goes off problem exists
twitter has gone way down hill and ive finally made the decision to delete the app if the or more bot population doesnt bother you the constant videos of people dying on your home page or the massive problem they have with bots spamming csam material or the fact that its turned into a propaganda machine for the trump republicans by the owner himself if you for whatever reason havent used x please dont this app is one of the worst out there
the app is trash now posts wont load and most of the app is ads you cant even block the account of anymore because theyre built into the app elon is trash blocking doesnt work anymore the app is getting worse aswell
i use it mostly for the news other members points of view on various subjects i have not seen any censoring done at this time overall a good app since it changed to x much better
i am downloading this app to time but every single time it has a one problem and that is account creation when i try for create an account just one notice appear on the screen that try again later
absolute trash elmo has replaced safe and responsible free speech with a wild west having few guardrails its been totally overrun by bots and spammers soon you cant block anyone even if theyre stalking you theres no way to know if youre even interacting with other humans and the algo will fill your feed with trash after the election im done with x forever
great app for getting up to date news and keeping up with friends its an easy to navigate platform without intrusive ads using it for business is also easy and it gives you a lot of options x is one of the only platforms that respects the right of free speech
this app used to be pretty decent and now its completely unusable its always loading router tweets dont load you have to press it a couple of times for it work nothing is what it used to be
after updating it makes the application keep loading in certain hour difficult to refresh i thought that because of my wifi but its not it freeze for more than minutes cant load no other social medias happened to be like this only this application this is ridiculous please fix it
the ads are overtaking the contents i prefer on my timeline if i wan na see some ads i can search for them not this app forcing it to my mouth and why all videos are displaying playback error mind you my connections are fine but none of the videos can be played smoothly ruin the experience for me i keep cleaning the cache or whatever but nothing change fix pleaseee
i opened an account just to see how it went and lo and behold i gained a whole new x family i am constantly discovering new capabilities that amaze me x has set the bar to the cosmos and i dont think any of these other platforms could even reach it
x app is one of social media apps it used be twitter before now its called x since acquired by elon musk on paid subscription some people claim that they get paid by posting their content i use it get to stay informed on general newstech trends and to stay in touch with some of people i know this app is user friendly app i give stars because it still much improvement
the trending page doesnt show the trends from a selected location you are forcing the users to see trends from a single region its quite irritating for eg if i select united states i still see trends from india
app still usable but the feature is getting worse update theyre so many useless feature tbf some are fine but mostly bad bad ui update its getting worse i wish i can give or even minus rating
used to be a great app but today the app is all you need to ruin your twitterx experience dont get me wrong twitterx is still great on my web browser but this app is a mess hangs wont load videos refuses to retrieve messages etc and all the while everything works just fine when i access twitterx via web browser it used to be a great app but it now needs serious help
the experience is continuing to decline autoadvancing videos is the worst part and when auto play is disabled you dont get to replay before it advanced to the next one
why is this called x twitter was so much nicer and friendly also everything was called a tweet because of the birds name and logo it looks like a porn site app now and is just weird and awkward i like elon but this is a mistake at least bring the name back with the original logo twitter
there are many bots who in there bio give links and follow many accounts so that anyone can see them i am tired by blocking them also there is a suggestion that when there were many tweets in following column please after clicking the show more button start from the past means that again scroll down and then scroll up that i dont like
lot of errors i heart posts esp does i like to come back to but when i check my like count on my profile it is not there bookmarks i bookmark posts and when i check my bookmarks it is not there also lags a lot like wth elon give x back to the old owners
was a fun app until it turned into an echo chamber for politics people i used to see on my timeline disappeared due to their political views free speech is great as long as you get to control what you think is free speech
used to be good but now the app is full of porn ads degenerates and a lot of technical issues loading videos not to mention i keep getting locked out of my account for no reason and i still havent had any access to it since yesterday idk what i was expecting from twitter but i at least expected a functional app
as someone new to x im still figuring things out what stood out the most was right now this is the first company that didnt hound me for a review two seconds after i downloaded it they waited a respectable amount of time this is what put them at stars the first company to respect my time and experience perfect
i have not used a piece of equipment an app or the generative ai and not be impressed by elon musks leadership elon and the team he has assembled rock looking forward to his next years and what awaits yes x is amazing use it grok is slamming the search is in depth and has an ease of use that surpasses all other search engines try x you wont be disappointed unless your a hater if you are nothing is going to save you anyway
nothing loads anymore sometimes i think its my connection but other things chrome youtube works just fine multiple times when i open x the pictures and posts are just blacks thumbnails
dont know why its always show problem whenever i try to refresh and its always works slow to show new msgs or notifications today i change my some settings and boom your app stuck its not working damn you dont even deserve that one star totally hate for this app old one was good but after its become x you really acting like an ex but surely you people are not working properly
trashy app it closes out of nowhere and takes me to home screen cant even type my messages without getting kicked out from the app all chats disappear out of nowhere
unfiltered truth i regularly see stuff from multiple conflicting viewpoints i see very little opinion pieces and a lot of full clips that arent doctored or edited or trimmed to make a narrative its awesome
awful app experience stops working from the moment you put cell phone on charge better off using the website awful truly awful these bugs render app to be totally useless
only issue i have is with video playing on android devices sometimes the sound of the previous video will keep playing until you force stop the app even with many updates
crashes randomly all the time within the past minutes of writing this it has crashed times for seemingly no reason i would be midscroll and it will just close
excellent the place news proliferates first its not perfect but you genuinely get a wide array of opinions and discourse which unfortunately has become a rarity bot counts have been reduced greatly as well
i am deeply disappointed with the recent experience ive had on x over the past few weeks ive noticed a disturbing increase in highly inappropriate ads being displayed in my feed these ads are not only offensive but also completely irrelevant to my interests and preferences as a platform that prides itself on being a space for meaningful conversations and connections it is shocking to see such content being allowed on x this is not what i signed up for
so many bugs on this app the feed doesnt load sometimes or refreshes i cant even get my dms to open without it crashing times in a row before l get lucky and it decides to work
theyve changed the block function to be completely useless and updating their ai policy so no one can opt out this app has truly reached its low no wonder everyone is leaving
ive always had a great experience with x i love being able to find news in my local area using xs search feature i keep in touch with local sports events its the coolest app and its always reliable the x app is the first to be installed when i factory data reset my mobile
does not load content reliably replies frequently fail to post the mobile browser version is much more reliable what a disappointment edit this app just keeps getting worse it is continuing its downhill slide of unreliability itd becoming almost pointless to use accessing x through a web browser is much better
awful since elon took over it has become a haven for hateful content and extremists there are also lots of accounts advertising onlyfans in the comments of almost every tweet exploiting the paid blue tick system the implementation of the revenue sharing programme incentivises bots to post and repost other peoples content it is also really glitchy and most videos dont play properly it is surviving off the community built from before elon took over but i really hope it dies soon
not bad putting direct messages reception behind a subscription while they were free in the past make it unusable as a free customer support platform i understand twitterx needs to make money but plz add new paid features not to make old ones paid
for an app that claims to have free speech it seems to suspend anyone who says anything that isnt bigotry i see people saying they should kill people for no reason every update as of recently has just been useless hiding likes and trying to get rid of the block feature is idiotic the only useful update was the media tab
just created new account used for min and closed the app and after min when i open the app there is nothing to see i cant see any comments and my feed isnt refreshing at all and cant see new tweets from the following persons worst experience ever from a app seriously just use of hrs of downloaded the app isnt working at all and when i open comments or any other like quotes or replies its buffering a lot still it did show up the comments
after elon changed everything its become a porn site every time you scroll theres a sex video the block button has been compromised if you block someone they are still allowed to see your post and interact with your comments the app has gone completely down hill all the ads are in support of the republic party or only fans
like the app but it crashes a lot lately and it even says cant retrieve posts at this time please try again later and failed to send post lately other than that like the app
constant ads and i can no longer use the search for keywords or by hash tag in tweets i never used to have any issues or complaints with twitter until all the changes recently
the functionality of this site has dropped off a cliff since musk took it over it is now full of extreme content that it has become impossible to filter avoid at all costs a complete cesspit
does not work on samsung phone when charging feed wont load and cant interact with posts has been this way for over months and counting hopeless since musk took over update still not resolved and reviews go unanswered
tons of porn sooo many ads unblockable accounts muteblock dont work uses a crazy amount of background data just a very poorly designed app that runs terribly slow
i finally got back my x account but lost all past history and followers and following it was a struggle and truly annoying and draining i must admit i am used to this app it would be brilliant if it hasnt become a zionist tool but then so all most of the apps these days but if you learn the narrative it can get great posts by experienced users who are very savy and fast updates too i think owners of these apps should stop the zionists strangulating them to the point of ridicule
honestly this the worst app version of decades elon musk bring wierd feature on this app why the hell asking for confirmation of bot while login there is no option to go ahead stucked in that bot test i updated the old version of app and its automatically logout trying to get login but stucked therei forgot my account details and irritating questions googleplaystore
sluggish mediocre buggy pathetic i have ran out of words it doesnt work smoothly as it should be elon musk thinks that he is genius he can do anything but cant run his application smoothly when you fire your employees think you can manage all the stuffs then obviously you are totally wrong get well soon or i have to uninstall it
im having trouble with dms any time i try to text someone the app crashes and i cant do anything i have to completely close the app then open it again just to get back to the main page
nice app not as compromised as others but it keeps logging me out of my second account each time i switch account it requires that i will prove that im human by performing some captcha verification process its painfully annoying you made me give up on one of my accounts youve failed to retrieve after logging it out pls i dont want that issue again
what is this weird ripoff of bluesky its like someone has just badly cloned bluesky or even threads and made it worse by removing all the good parts its a really weird kind of app i dont know why you would use this over the original bluesky
this app used to be a good place for news and commentary but for the last couple of years has descended into conspiracy theory and propaganda im off to look for something better
new block feature does not let users actually block people blocked users can still view your page which is illegal and a direct violation of the play stores rules get this app removed from the play store please this could lead to so many dangerous situations
environment of the app is very poorly managed ever since the take over of elon allow interaction farming of bots posting irrelevant comments and doesnt take any action to improve the users experience of the app futhermore elon keeps trying to mess with the block function for users to still be able to see each others posts which should be against the app stores policy
half the time it doesnt load the other half its blue check bots or irrelevant ads scroll pages to find a real human and they are getting ready to deactivate the account dont waste time here
x has more improvement additions every day i absolutely love this app and how it functions yes it has a few issues here and there they are being worked id jump in and get monetized today
this app is very annoyance almost everery to days your account has been locked and needs verificationif you unfortunately get your account suspended its not easy for you to restore it back to normalcy you might contact the support for multiple times without any response
full of pornographic accounts that spam requests to be your followers regularly put their links to onlyfanspornsites on public post ads too much ads that try to blend in posts even when you scrolling away it stretches longer occupied your whole screen bots no prevention or countermeasures idiot ai that comments strangely to raise engagement more and more trashy posts and stollen contents accounts got hacked after x add monetization
i have an issueneither pictures nor videos on x is showing despite numerous attempts of deleting storage and its cache and turning on and off wifi it only comes back when i reinstall it and when i do it only show me something went wrong please try again everytime i try to log in using google its hussle please try to fix this issue asap
xtwitter works about of the time on android half the time the homepage just doesnt load or refresh and not able to watch any videos or visit pages been like this for past year or so
used to be good now filled with garbage ads you cant turn off breaks constantly algorithm absolutely slanted not missing this app
a federated software package backed by a network that is solar powered and distributed globally unprecedented one the way it was purchased two the way it compliments the starlink system for open source news three the ability communicate in an emergency situation for first responders those who have situational awareness of open source news worthy issues it has some flaws but maturing as a premier social messaging app you got mail has grown up
had to re review i mostly use the web version lately as there are times without notice that the android app would not load anything successfully initially thought it was my network connection
fairly new user but so far its super easy to navigate around i havent experienced any censoring i was watching a fairly long pod cast and had no commercials which was awesome hats off to elon musk and his team for providing an open platform where no matter what you want to say its okay to say
this is the worlds worst and fraudulent application they take the subscription money and then automatically create some problems in your account which keeps you troubled this has happened to me twice once after taking rupees the account was suspended and the second time after taking rupees the account was put in spam i dont like it and never use this application
this app remains a popular platform for realtime news and social interaction its streamlined interface and robust features allow users to easily share thoughts engage with trends and connect with others however the changes in policies and features have sparked mixed reactions overall its a dynamic space for conversation though its direction continues to evolve
i am beyond disappointed ive updated and reinstalling it for the past few days and my timeline still wont refresh i cant even see the lates tweets cause of your app keeps on crashing down now the videos showing on my timeline can not be played its always on playback error i cant even watch the videos that shows up on my timeline
team x i am not getting username i want for my account when i tried to make a account with the username i want as the username i want is available right now but when i clicked next option after entering the username i want it automatically selected the autofilled prefilled suggested username and not the username i entered and now when i try to change the auto selected username it says username has not updated what is this please fix this problem
got worse after elon took over ever since elon bought it out all its been is broken and buggy with terrible tos breaking updates and fascist racist and even nazi posts and accounts being heavily supported and advertised i would not recommend using this app in its current state and leadership as its not worth the hassle it causes id recommend you use the social media platform bluesky instead
i like the app but the feed is always random refreshing while i am looking at something which is incredibly frustrating this make the app almost unusable please fix
i am having issues with call i call someone and they say there is an issue with the others phone or app theres nothing wrong with everyones account but my account i tried to clear the cache and even cleared the data but it didnt help i have also checked the permissions and ive granted all permissions and also checked the call settings but still unable to do so
the app is constantly in hunting mode trying to update itself which makes it unusable for a lot of the time it never used to be like this and the updates dont solve it
the app itself works well but quality of content and users took a nose dive since it changed hands i started getting new follows from obvious botsscammersfake accounts ads were added to the comments thread i used to find twitter invaluable for realtime information now its full of ads bots and trolls ymmv some people enjoy the new of environment its not for me i only ever open it if someone specifically points out a good thread to me which is now practically never
cool app edit the app was cool since a few days ago the videos change to the next video by themselves you could watch and listen to the videos without having to open them and now you cant it became a billboard for onlyfans accountsadds and the worst of all due to the monetization there are tons of comments and posts within posts off topic in every post which makes the experience not enjoyable
the app as a opposed to the web version is not as intuitive to find things like trending live spaces etc eg looked for elon musk live stream video from pa no luck went to my pc to view app needs to make things easier to find
this app has an annoying bug when you go to dms to type something it kicks you out randomly sometimes out of the app entirely or sometimes just to the list of people to dm and when it happens it also does the annoying refresh bug on the timeline too so you cant try to resend the tweet if you are sending a tweet to somebody at the time please fix this it is very annoying
another video or an ad will immediately start playing at the end of every video theres no way to disable this stupid feature in the settings why did you add this elon its ridiculous
the latest update has made sharing your own tweet next to impossible if you try to copy and paste more than one thing to a tweet it crashes if you try to add a gif to your tweet it crashes wtg
only app left from mainstream social media that supports free speech every other app has some form of censorship or filter that gets you shadow banned or warned it has its issues but its a better news source than most legacy media because of realtime community note fact checks elon supports free speech so i support x stars
it doesnt load the videos dont even buffer enough to watch in the entirety like for real cant watch a second video without it freezing qrts are limited replies full of bots christ what a downfall
the new owner that renamed what is now x is also owner of space x a private space program elon musk he has been successfully launching what is called satellite trains into orbit with the intention of gaining access to every device or equipment that relies on satellite transmissions to operate effectively under the false pretence of access for all the poor behavior of the app is due to musk working ou bugs to complete the process of knowing where everyconnected device is wo your knowledge
i enjoy using x do the fact that we have the ability of still having the first amendment freedom of speech pro other sites lately ive been using have been very anti free speech i prefer not having censorship thank you
the timeline will show you really cool posts then reload you see people you block on your timeline liked posts sometimes wont show up in your liked list same thing with reposts bluesky is generally better
why does the for you section contain so many bot accounts it is literally full of accounts that are violating the rules but you dont do anything to get rid of these stupid accounts the for you section is garbage just get rid of it why do you put a ridiculous amount of interests in my interests section it is extremely annoying i have the show sensitivity media setting adjusted so that i should never see any of the offensive content but it literally does nothing because i still see it
i use this for my news source i stayed out of politics and news because i never knew what was true anymore now that ive found x that is not a problem its been proven over and over again real news free speech and faster than the networks get anything out probably because the doctoring up the stories takes time thanks elon out of
riddled with bots and scammers constantly following and messaging you changing the block feature to barely do any actual blocking anymore and likely wont comply with many countries regulations frequent issues loading posts and the algorithm promotes nothing but rage bait these days twitter continues to get worse every day do yourself a favor and switch to bluesky
lets pretend the new update where blocking anyone will still allow them to see your content makes sense whats the point in blocking someone if theyll still be able to know your entire life unless you make your profile completely private its okay lets just pretend youre not breaking the tos and invading user privacy you developers of this app can keep going you will get far like this probably to rock bottom
the app does frequently have bugs and glitches normally loading and connection issues a new one that is happening is the first video you click to watch then scroll past and the audio from that video is playing over the current video being watched
after i reactivated one of my accounts ive ran into an issue regarding showing followers and followings now ive deactivated my account for a awhile before for a long time but nothing was wrong now for some reason i cant follow anyone or do anything regarding that matter
i can not sign up to xx or even sign up through google can someone please tell me what i am doing wrong i sign up then i sign in and then it says there is something wrong and keeps reading directing me to the front page
really immensely disliking the new update where people you block can still see your content its almost like i blocked them for a reason got ta love the way this feels so wrong and invasive amazing update for cyber stalkers im sure
the app is alright my only issue with it is that it randomly stops working even with internet this usually happens whenever im off the app for a while and then opening it up again
the app is always loading and having issues every second i cant even search a word because theres always an error also i want to deactivate my account but i cant because its suspended without giving any reason i dont even use my account the reason why i want to deactivate it but the app wont let me because it was suspended this suspension has been going on for years years okay you should fix your app seeing that a lot of users also have problems with it
the general function is simplistic its a stream of posts and everyone can like and comment in a stack of comments it doesnt necessarily incentivise long form content with source references or discussions but it is quite open you can choose who to follow community notes are helpful and most importantly it doesnt deletecensor your comments like other platforms
the app doesnt work you can be using the app for as long as you want have an account everything set up perfectly then the next day you get on and it just logs you out or the next day you get on your band or the next time you get on your account just dont exist anymore im done with this app this app sucks dont use x i rather use reddit
absolute garbage of an app has logged me out twice in the past months and couldnt get back in then my account got hacked never had this experience when it was twitter you timeline will also get bombarded with us politics ill be looking for an alternative
app is atrocious every update breaks something new and will never be fixed my for you trending shouldnt be showing me fight videos and gore no body wants that content no body asked for that content
i use an s ultra and my experience in the past months using the app has been poor there are frequent crashes and the timeline never updates until hours later i also have an iphone and the app runs seamlessly on it so im guessing its the android version that has issues ive cleared cache severally and restarted the app severally but it doesnt solve it
ever since the takeover this app has gotten worse and worse with each update implemented tweets dont even load sometimes there are so many glitches that make it frustrating to use and why does it keep refreshing posts
video player has been completely broken for months now on samsung s and s extremely buggy search function rarely works and refresh is bugged
viewing quotes been broken for months now you are constantly getting told theres no quotes to view despite the numbers saying otherwise search feature is horrendous bots everywhere racism and homophobia extremely prevalent dm feature crashing the app repeatedly as well horrible just horrible the owner is a massive pos as well
doesnt work when charging playback error on every video having to refresh and not keep you at the tweet since elon has taken over the app has fell of a cliff elon make a maintaince team and fix your app
love this app but keeps freezing and restarting i have the updated version not too sure why it keeps freezing and reloading
almost every single day at some point nothing will load cant load my main feed or anyones profile no videos or photos will load it mostly happens in the afternoons or evenings twitter devs please fix this app or fix the servers its not normal for an app to go down for minutes every day that just bad business
since twitter has been bought by elon musk and it turned into x it has also turned into a brothel any time i make a comment or respond to a female user i get lost of likes from users who promote pornography or even prostitutions and this is shameful i keep using this app just because i made a lot of friends around the world and i wouldnt ever want to lose them but i have to say that x is far much worse than the old twitter
of the time the app is constantly refreshing it refuses to load anything almost everything is just grey this is a horrible app its run by a horrible and idiotic person on top of that they falsely deactivated my account because i got hacked and someone used it for horrible actions this is why bluesky is way better all good twitter users move bluesky quickly before its too late
idk any positive things to say about the app anymore it did more downgrades than upgrades because he tried to generate some money for free services elsewhere he is one of those insufferable characters that is really bad at naming things that everyone refuses to note that this was named twitter for someone considered brilliant he sure does idotic decisions those who agreed to sell this to him better lose all they got and more as karma greedy bstrds had it all coming
thank you elon keep making this thing better ps on the lg tvs its ridiculously slow it takes quite a while to go from one video to the next and the whole thing could use a little work but i love the phone app keep doing what youre doing
elon musk ruined the app end of story the app crashes constantly media player is completely broken now the amount of bots doubled and its super hard to find real people commenting on posts the amount of nsfw posts are ridiculous and you can still see them even of your account is underage this app is just breaking apart since elon took ownership every day and its just sad to see
app throws me into a constant login loop despite me very clearly being logged in on multiple accounts even if i try to log in it doesnt let me into the app and instead throws me right back onto the login screen histwitter
i x it is constantly improving and adding new features there are strong incentives for creators its much better than old twitter since musk took over in terms of functionality and freedom of expression its my go to social media ap
i dont know why but im not able to change my profile picture on x and it really disappointed me the last time i changed my pfp was about a year but now im not able to change first it shows that my pfp is changed but when i open my account again my pfp again changes to the old one i used before
i am new to the app by only a few days now love the free speech bit as any sane person would im not tech savvy so to speak but im sure ill navigate my way round i can see honest opinions and thoughts of people who matter in and for the world some of whom l admire and respect find myself commenting on things l shouldnt even bother with and im also sure ill tone that down i love it and look forward to seeing hearing and interacting with others in future
twitter was great but then x turned it into a land of total bots also the volume of fake news and alternative facts is breathtaking two thumbs down
not only is this platform frustrating to use its feature set is getting worse with every random update that falls out of musks head what used to be a tolerable service is now a husk of a social media platform ran by someone who cant take hearing the word no unless hes paid a month of course and how is the charging bug still a thing like why does the app stop working the moment i need to charge my device its ludicrous insanity even
i genuinely do not understand why musk is doing what hes doing because hes just ruining the app what do you mean that people can still view our profile even if weve blocked them that has to violent some terms of service and not to mention the ads on this platform i wouldve given it a zero rating if that was possible
ive had x before it became x when it was twitter and have had it for years and i got a new phone and ever since i downloaded the app on my new phone and have glitches ever since keep getting notifications i have a bug i never had this problem until i downloaded the x app on the new phone in my old phone i had twitter and when it updated to x on the old phone it didnt glitch any
free speech is so rare ty for making this one of the only platforms that have and encourage free speech the only platform in which fact checking can be done by anyone best and most reliable app for journalism absolutely brilliantly changed a not functioning platform with shadowbans to a beautiful platform that constantly improves
i have been seeing so many loan ads in my timeline out of nowhere if you keep popping them up everytime i opened the app surely you the most disturbing app and i have no doubt to uninstall x
i have been using twitter since i only ever use this app to look at news announcements or opinions of important outlets i never post anything this social media platform hasnt changed much since its been renamed x and anyone saying different is saying that for political reasons only and complaining about ads is ridiculous its a free app and one that is part of an advertiser boycott i dont agree with a lot of opinions on x but i feel more comfortable knowing they wont be banned
terrible and bloated with features you will absolutely not use ever in addition the block button will not function properly and will still allow blocked users to still see your posts
this twitter video bug is really bothering me now like i dont even watch videos on here any more because they dont loadplay but advertisement videos play perfectly without any issues
after some x updates i noticed pictures and feeds are slow to load as of late i thought it was on my end but its not hopefully x will get this resolve
everyone like this so it can be better seen elon musk plans to essentially neuter the block button feature by still allowing blocked users to see the content of people theyve been blocked by this is an awful change that goes directly against tos of both google play and the apple store please look into this and have him reverse the change because this decision might just render the app unusable
all is good but there is a problem with the media playback it doesnt run smoothly and keeps getting stuck for quite long even when my internet connection is good i hope it get solved soon
cant elon fix his app i cant send photos anymore in the group chats and it freezes for around seconds when i wan na type something and then it freezes again when i wan na send something please fix this thanks
the app is so much worse since it became x it shows me tweets im not interested in while when it was twitter my tl was full of stuff i liked and tweets of my moots also now its been weeks i have this problem where every time i open the app it asks me to log in so i have to close it and reopen it a couple of times until its fine plus i cant create a new account i tried on my phone on tablet and on pc and it keeps saying theres been an error and the new rebranding is awful
sucks experience i saw a post an important and informative post wanted to interact and then this app logs me out saying i was log out coz of an error i have been experiencing this for decades but this very moment hurts most
the dm section i cant even send a message whenever i try the app will just automatically be close i have to try at least three or four times before i can really send a message
you cant watch videos its always going to the next video which is irrelevant to the previous video and what makes it frustrating thats in ios you can disable it which here you cant
being blocked from making rd acct first time ever a twx acct first two hacked illegal unauthorized admingog git take over every device gets connected to unknown server or wifi we dont have was told xfinity blocked our address but its constantly trying to connectbeen reporting this non stop for years to be intercepted only apn option unknown name home all started with fbvz n xfinity all our lifes info uploaded to unknown vz cloud
previous update i commented that when i want to comment using a gif the app takes so much time to even load the gif very bad experience whereas now the app doesnt even let me comment when i use a gif it plainly says failed to send tweet the experience of x on android is pathetic and its getting worse day by day
the block function was just announced as basically cosmetic with people you blocked still being able to view your content great day for stalkers thanks can no longer opt out of having your posts used to train ai models against your consent great app just kidding
great app lost th star due to the search i try and type what i want to watch and i only get video of it watching random vids ill come across way more of what i want not to mention only content creators pop up when searching im new to x atm about a week so i dont know creators to search for
it only gets worse as we go unblockableunmuteable ads everywhere that open playstore if you accidentally tap them video autoplay feature that can not be turned off
this app is changing the block feature making it so posts can be viewed by blocked accounts if yours is public even though they cant do anything but why make this change the app is horrible its always crashing it has not improved elon has ruined it for everyone
way too many ads excessive amount of ads annoying amount of ads especially dumb monopoly go and temu ads not paying to get rid of that many ads i rather delete the app
nothing works since the last update when i close the app it takes away all the notifications with it before i can scan through them
loving twitter in now its and its became a bot haven and a sub modelnow its and elon owns the platform has promised free speech but has failed in many other ways the verification for a pfp and blue paid membership are a farse you cant change or edit pfps after verification its like paying for a frozen account with less usage
cant add mobile number cuz it asks me to send a msg to a number which is international and consequently since my sim cant send internationally so cant verify my mobile number other apps send you an otp instead thats much more easier
changing the way blocking works by allowing others to see and not interact does not stop screenshots and harassment this app is gradually becoming a dumpster fire fast
extremely buggy the auto scroll for videos is unnecessarily made to increase the views of videos extremely toxic and predatory and just recently they we cant block people properly anymore
whenever i launch the application it always automatically refreshes and i end up loosing the content i was viewing please rectify this problem its frustrating
i like audio and video sharing features of x its not very complex as the others but improvement and changes should be make for more user retention algorithm is very different from the other social apps but very minor if you use premium offcourse yes i dont have it
it was fine good even when it was twitter since it was bought up its become a mess tons of bots on it lots of inflammatory people trying to get a rise or of people for clicks for profit misinformation everywhere on it i highly do not recommend this app
would anyone care to explain to me why the app refuses to function load anything while the phone is charging how is that something that hasnt been fixed for quite a while now even with updates recently would think you would want to make sure people can use your product right
i have had a very good experience in this app it is continually growing rich in features that enhance the unique user experience i highly recommend this app smoothe continuous scrolling feeds and the pay version has many benefits a
i cant block ads that are bordering on indecent bring back blocking functions for ads i keep clicking that i dont want to see the ad but it still appears
as law and play store rules a possibilities to blockmute unwanted content is mandatory putting my account on private doesnt delete bs from my feed to decide what i want to read and whom i want to read is a legal right moreover you need to block unwanted followers or get yourself removed from unwanted lists get it fixed
the app now features these aggressive ads that affect scrolling trying to read a post and it just takes me to the ad after it repeatedly like a post same behaviour its just almost unusable now unless you want to pay uncle elon maybe
this app is the worst works fine in twitter era but now its literally trash app unstable keeps crashing every time i scroll down the timeline gets updated nothing fixed
about once day the app freezes up and wont load new tweets or let me like or look at replies to the tweets that are already loaded after about an hour or two it will work again for a while then go back to this state
only complaint about this app as a free user is the lack of optimization on android its very bad compared to other social media apps like facebook or instagram even threads this app has a tendency to have stutters and lag while scrolling and tapping on a photo every minute or so
im completely fine with ads popping up every few post but those invasive autoplayvideo ads even when i have autoplay disabled are out of line this might be what finally drives me out of this app
the app literally stops working when you charge your phone its kinda funny also cant change your icon or name without triggering some kind of bot detection that basically requires you to use a browser to fix
block feature is removed so anyone blocked is essentially unblocked now and can see your stuff pushes misinformation pay to win type of content for blue checks and littered with add that dont go away even after hitting i dont like this
this platform has become an absolute cesspit over the last few years spearheaded by musk and his vitriolic rhetoric the sooner the platform dies and people move to a better managed platform the better oh thats not even to mention the countless bugs and irrelevant ads since his buyout how the guy got so rich is an absolute mystery
newest feature basically disabling the blockbutton and justifying it with more transparency while also having hidden peoples likes suspicious now no one can even protect themselves by blocking people nice going with this app
dont be fooled by all these star haters with their imagined slights x does exactly what it says on the tin if youre looking a vision of the world this is definitely the platform to get it its like sitting on your front porch while the whole world goes by and you get to hear all the conversations and very occasionally i add my tuppence worth i can even watch the videos on my tv now they have an app for the firestick if you want to be part of the conversation or just observe it x
the app constantly glitches theres not one day where it runs smoothly every time and every day its always glitching constantly loading and taking forever elon why dont you fix your platform
app keeps crashing everytime i login and whatever i type for posting does not get restored it often happens when i am using the dm feature i would appreciate if it is fixed on an immediate basis
this app has become borderline unusable and the experience will only continue to spiral downwards removing the block feature is a stupid idea allowing bots to run rampant is a stupid idea making likes private only helps a very specific demographic that elon very obviously belongs to dont even get me started on the premium subscription
at times the app will not refresh the timeline then audio from different videos playing at the same time audio from adds not even on the page playing over other audio
i paid for to be upgraded to monthly premium service last week but my account has not been upgraded i was previously mischarged for two premium accounts but google said that was resolved what next thank you
x is the best platform to get the truthful news by upgrading to paid version i get to use grok which is the ai run by x for free which is much cheaper than chatgpt i get reduce ads and get more visibility on my replies and post most importantly i want to contribute to supporting free speech i am not a content creator but because these were the reasons i upgraded to premium service on x
the app has problems in general but it works well enough however as soon as i plug in my charger its just completely useless how is this a problem faced in the app was working smoothly before
video player has been broken for months advertisements and replies to any post are now all verified accounts that post either unrelated content to farm for views or nsfw content that is bumped right to the top of the replies i have to close the app multiple times to get my timeline to load no longer does the trending tab have articles and news so its pointless to have as a window broken app that only continues to get worse
great app only thing i wish i would ask elon to work on is the content algoritm on tiktok the a helps you find new related content that os interesting on x my tineline after min i am done reading and i miss new good content from users that i dont know yet
this apps lags a loti thought my phone has issuebut this lagging problem is not present in other social media appsthis occurs especially when there is an ad post come in between my feedsplease fix this
ever since the last update ive been having problems with the samsung keyboard when trying to post i keep getting an error it only does it when using x app please fix this asap
very bad app the app literally does not work can not load any posts or media data messages dont open this is not functional and its unacceptable
always interrupted with either freeze screens or app crashing altogether also the app will open but not refresh or actually process my likes and retweets never had this problem when i had an iphone
i followed all the news sites i usually check each day and i have noticed a better news experience also followed some other sources that i didnt use to check sort of like when you get a newspaper and just pull out the sections youre interested in x is better than visiting different news websites one and done
many duplicate posts in the for you tab full of bots the app doesnt work while the phone is charging i keep receiving notifications when people stream even though i disabled them
every day there are always certain times where the x app fails to load the timeline it also can not be refreshed ive tried clearing cache and restarting the phone but it didnt work i also still have the twitter lite app installed on my phone it still functions normally without any issues so clearly the problem here is in x app
i have paid for a subscription and it wont let me post reply quote add followers or add bookmarks there is no help desk i have uninstalled and reinstalled the ap i have cleared the cache and have rebooted still not working
does not have any privacy controls using user content as they want to unethical to artists in any form paintings writings even voice actings overall a terrible platform for people worldwide
used to be my favourite social media app but now its just the one i use more i have no clue why the show thread indicator was removed very unintuitive i open the app and sometimes it literally doesnt workno image or nothing loadingand im literally connected video quality is horrendous app just feels a serious downgrade from twitter
can someone please fix the issue with the app concerning showing whats trending ive tried setting the explore location to us but its showing the trends of another country
ridiculous you have to pay to edit something you posted just pure greedy and it feels times more complicated to use pretty sure every other social media is better than this also my account for my youtube channel got suspended for breaking rules when i never broke any rules and when i tried to appeal it would just tell me to log out and in again or change my passwords nothing changed elon has ruined twitter
x sucks it purposefully throttles small accounts pay for premium still throttled plus features like editundo have bugs that make them dysfunctional i have dozens of posts that automatically get sent to the draft folder because x has bugs whats the point of posting or replying when x stifles reach they call it a free speech platform but they limit reach so why not just censor people outright why am i paying for this other than being the best source for breaking news x is awful
rating star until elon fixes video auto scroll on android and actually clamp down on the bot spam infestation like he said he would on apple devices you have the option to disable the auto advance video feature but on android this is not available as far thr spam if youre making an account today be ready to mute block a lot of accounts just to make using it bearable every big tweet has loads of of spam straight up scams advertising in the replies
unstable crashes often and sometimes your timeline wont load at all unless you reopen and close the app multiple times or leave it to sit there for about minutes
the app works very well it loses a star for changing what it used to represent a short text it loses another star for turning into a battleground rather than a platform for information and awareness
as of the app itself is completely dead for me just a black screen with an x nothing opens or loads absolutely awful sad to see how far this app has fallen since the purchase
regardless of the network conditions the app is frequently freezing and stays for hours before this happens from time to time but now it is daily
been trying to make an account countless times previously but even after having such a fine network the app keeps on saying that please try again it makes me so frustrated there are some certain news that can only be found on x otherwise i wouldnt have bothered with this app i request to quickly resolve this issue
i can have a look and a feeling at last news i can join people far away its amazing its really a strong connection about news it looks like reading a newspaper or watching breaking news all together and can say the own feeling about better if more polite although is similar to many others where people practice a kind of cyberbullism its just my opinion
the app is not loading at all i tried uninstalling it and installing it again in a hope that the problem goes away but now the app is not at all loading when i try to click on the log in link please fix this problem
nothing really works there anymore app crashes every five minutes and you literally cant send any message or post properly media especially videos barely load and app shuts down randomly when youre trying to type anything
works fine only some ui features cause the scroll to change position when moving from one page to another or disliking an advertisement cause you to get rejected from the reply tree you were reading
aside from the algorithm making it to where your followers dont see your tweets more often than they actually do the owner of the co has come out saying that hes looking into essentially making the block button obsolete by making it to where blocked people can still see your posts but cant interact with them which defeats the purpose of it and actually goes against the tos of the app store since they require social media apps to have a block button to stop harassment its become awful
people are hilarious the app is meh poor search suggestions what does top even pull from when youre literally looking for specific keywords and all the ads and promoted posts are very obviously conservative more frustrating and annoying than anything else
my posts with images and videos are taking way too long like up to days and still they dont get posted but are sent to straight to draft and i have data with high signal strength
suggestions for expanding who i follow are unneeded and not relevant suggested content takes up almost half of my screen making it difficult to scroll past them without accidentally opening them side note since my primary use of twitter is for local news and severe weather info the default to top tweets after updates is inconvenient
i dont know what should you do with the app but it doesnt work when my smartphone is connected to a wall charger getting endless loading spinner as soon as i disconnect it all fine
make an actual functioning app this takes a solid minutes to reload the fyp how my wifi is under the best possible plan i can get through my work and im the only one at home using the wifi make a functioning app please
i used this app since it was called twitter now its full of bots most of the replies are aigenerated verified accounts lots of constant negativity too no matter what you post someone will reply something negative with it cause it brings up their engagement its not worth using this app anymore
i have no idea what the last update did but i can open the app normally it always asks me to login only way ive found to get onto the app logged in is to prees and hold select search press back then open the app
i dont know why i installed the app and created account but it doesnt work it keeps saying something went wrong then i unstalled and again install and update but its same doesnt working at all plz kindly fix it for me
i feel this application which has recently removed the ability to block other users from viewing your content and forces you to view unwanted content goes against googles terms of service and should be removed from the play store until such time as that feature is restored
app has gone severely downhill never loads timeline and when it does work playback on videos is delayed and its a cesspool of scam ads on the verge of useless
xwitter is changing the block feature to not really be a block at all which can have dangerous consequences and i believe it goes against the rules set by google play to be able to download the app from here someone needs to make clear to a certain billionaire what that means
app doesnt work half the time buggy and sometimes crashes or wont load content it also doesnt always disclose what is and isnt an ad and it shows fake headlines from news articles
hey x ive been using x for years and i found that x has new features where we can do calls and video calls but why i cant do that its kinda upset where i cant do call or receive calls from someone on x hm i want that features tooo or is it because im using android does android not support calls on x ahhhh this is so frustrating please i want that features too pleaseee
too many spam accounts i get constantly flooded with people just promoting their only fans and there needs to be a way to verify who you are without having to pay i feel that all that talk about saving free speech is behind a paywall which is kind of contrary to the idea of free speech otherwise its a great app
its so much better now the liberals cant walk all over people and control opinions any more you can actually talk to people on there freely without getting blocked every seconds much better with elon in charge
x tends to be my favorite social media app and its mostly the only one i use these days it also has been a top source of news for me for years especially when i want to know the most current breaking news before other sites old school media catches on to news looking forward to its continual growth and evolution
could you please fix any bugs regarding to direct message in this app i chat with my friend and whenever i want to chat with her the dm always seems laggy for no reason i have to delete the conversation and make a new one everytime the lags happen to fix the lagging issues please fix this do better
when it works its entertaining with quite a bit of ads the latest versions have a lot more ads than the previous ones and its always buffering
because of ur stupid policy of giving blue tick in just few money there r so many fake account got geting viral no body knows is it real or fake nd that account sharing lots of information my be it is worng who is responsible for that nd there is no text edit option what if some time text get mistek how can i edit nd we can only do limited text how can we complete my statement in few words even play store have more space then x increase text limit in x
taking out blocking is a violation to our rights and it can not be legally done also forcing artist to have their work stolen by ai is the last thing i needed to drop this hellsite is not like i could see interesting posts anymore bc all the bots took any interest i had on this away going to deactivate as soon as i get my mutuals other socials
absolutely awful ad experience an add after every post is not it pay for premium if you want to avoid it otherwise its not worth being on the platform
the photos and videos just wont load after this update i dont know if its a classic dns issue but seems like everyone is facing this
many twitter accounts appear to be throttled for no good reason likes are now private which is ridiculous current revision release has a bug causing it to crash
i dont know what has been happening to this app lately but it just works horrible videos and images take forever to load and sometimes they wont even load and once it fails to load a video if you go back the tweets wont even load at this point i prefer using the browser version of twitter rather than this app and thats saying a lot
star cause the name x is too bad i love the name tweeter very much now if anyone see my phone theyll judge my nature thanks for disappointment edit the like section is now gone i needed that it was great but now i am drowning the rating from to if like section getting added back then ill do straight please
i dont like this x because when i bought a new phone and migrated data into new phone first of all no directly get login into my x account and after that i dont know about username and i dont know about password also so i couldnt login so atlast its security is so third class because i cant get to know about my username and doesnt do the recovery email or phone also so it has so third class security to login in ur account
was awesome when i first made an account in now i can barely open the app without something breaking and not functioning no matter how times i restart the app i just want to like and retweet beautiful art why is this too much to ask
its a very cool social app but time and again it will freezecrash and you find other apps working but x will be crashed horrible experience since updating it for a couple of times
my goto app for quality information i see the world better and know things from a wider and critical perspective although it can get better if porn sites can be removed thats just a personal perspective though nevertheless x is far better and indeed it is the totem of free speech
its a good platform maybe a bit too political but its probably my fault because u choose who u follow i love the feature that shows if its a manipulated video there is so much miss information these days and it was nice to see
this platform has slid so far downhill in the past years now with blocking basically being made inefective im done ive used this platform since a year old account is now deleted elon was the worst thing to ever happen to twitter ill be watching it sink further while i stay safe on the shore
what an absolute bag of cp this app has become almost daily updates which im sure are to remove any last remaining good points of the app forcing ads on us at every available opportunity refreshing the screen so you cant find that tweet you were reading just a second ago if youre new to twitter lets face it x is a stupid name then dont bother if youve been here a while then im sure youve seen the decline yourself
the app will go long stretches of time of being borderline unusable unavoidable ads everywhere and of course the owner of the app has done much more to make a worse app
i love x because its full of entertainment and knowledge but lately its been very glitchy and media doesnt even load like it takes so long to load a video
elon musk has well truly successfully managed to destroy this app nothing works right from sex bots to broken media player timeline not loading multiple times in a day for no reason i dont want to see tweets from people that im not following everything about this app that cant work doesnt work
absolutely unusable i end up just going on to the web version to load posts in their entirety it doesnt work at all even though my app is seemingly up to date
ive been trying to make twitter account since months but it says something isnt right try your request again later i uninstalled this app and downloaded it again restart my mobile did everything possible please fix this issue
preelon this used to be a great app for me both privately and professionally now it seems severely broken i mostly get shown content that i do not find interesting that holds both for ads but also for usergeneraylted content moreover the app specifically is very buggy for instance the app just doesnt load comments and to read them i have to log in from my laptop videos sometimes dont work at all i find this frustrating because i used to enjoy twitter
while i have not received ten ads in a row like i have in the past i have now started getting ads for literal porn on my timeline when i follow nothing sexual i have tried getting rid of the adsbut they just keep coming back i dont have personalized ads why are you trying to force porn on people
changed the block function you can see their posts and they can see yours but they cant interact its a waste of everything i dont want to see their stuff and i dont want them to see mine do better
on the whole good but having a verified identity should be free or involve only a small one time cost there should also be a dislike marker for posts to give a more balanced indication of reactions subscriptions are expensive for someone than doesnt use the platform very much
since the new branding this app has gone downhill on android videos often freeze and pictures dont always show the feed doesnt load disappointing and annoying
the app is pretty dang good right now no significant issues missing some search options that some older thirdparty apps had but in no way do i feel limited by the official app
my user experience decreases in quality and enjoyment with every new decision they make removing very necessary features adding stuff nobody asked for its like they dont care anymore about the people that use this app edit i dont wan na have a halfusable block button the block function will lose its meaning and its unfair to everyone
i always having an issue to post or repost even after an hours its still like that its always happening when we have big events and need to use ht for trending please help me to fix the issue and email me regarding thistq
dear x support team i sincerely hope youre doing well its been over a week since i submitted an appeal for my account saqi to be unsuspended but i havent received any response yet i kindly request you to review my appeal and restore my account at your earliest convenience i truly value the platform and appreciate your support in resolving this matter thank you so much for your time and attention
always uptodate with current affairs lately i cant access any tweets even if im logged in something is not right with twitter happy to confirm that the twitter app is now functioning very well to the way i know it keep up the good work
ever since twitter changed to x user experience is getting worse now theyre changing the block feature which allows people weve blocked to view our content purpose of block feature to stop certain parties from viewing engaging users content theyre literally violating user privacy
would rate much higher if there was a way to turn off the stupid new auto advance feature when watching videos how out of touch can these developers be to not have an option for that
stopped using social media about years ago x came along and i thought id give it a try it has curated all social media for me helping me navigate other social media algorithms by finding good people trying to provide accurate info from multiple perspectives by following those people on youtube its helped me find other helpful people is not found previously due to the cage the original also was putting me in love this platform
the new tos literally makes it so thst whatever you upload they can use for ai and stsrting nov you wont be able to opt out is removing the block feature which is really messed up do not recommend elon has no idea how to run a site
it stops working at least once everyday which is so annoying at times very very poor backend since it has become x from twitter getting worse day by day it has ritual of going down every day what pathetic backend
i do not get to see all of the content of the people i follow the app is being overrun by bots and content farms and the adspromoted content is all crypto and other nonsense it incentivizes bad faith interaction and baffling decisions are continuously made to threaten the safety of its users
fails to load new info when opening the app multiple times a day no rhyme or reason no way to fix it just takes its time and comes back when it wants to
not sure what is going on but after the newest update my notifications are lagging having a hard time with dms kept saying app wasnt responding and then shut down
this app sucks both functionally and the experience of using it download if you want ads in a row or more think you havent seen enough of the worst kinds of people want constant playback errors on videos feeds refreshing as youre looking at something its pretty much gone forever now endless bots and a ceo whos doing everything to make it worse while clearly trying to hide all the analytic data from everyone in hopes to guard his ego and trick companies back into advertising here
almost not even usable im all for free speech but this app just loads and loads at least half of the time update as someone elses review says it wont load when you have your phone plugged into the charger
its never works right of the time since elon took it over i try closing all apps and restarting phone but usually doesnt help it used to work perfectly when it was twitter
getting rid of the block feature in such a great move what other awesome features will be included next maybe it will just give stalkers your home address edit forgot to add that this is a playground for russian propaganda overridden by bots and misinformation
twitter is very toxic and bugs got worse after x also its really stupid that people cant see your comments if you protect your posts protecting your posts shouldnt automatically ruin the ability to communicate with others the app doesnt let me change my profile picture or background
whats wrong with this app most of time its not reload the photos i have to reinstall everytime if i want to see any photos and the video stuck in the middle
x keeps crashing to a white screen in the middle of posting and responding to comments dms no longer work either utterly frustrating zero stars
i have been using this app since it was called twitter even before i signed up for instagram but one thing i like about insta is the new feature of profile lock for strangers in both fb ig which is not available with twitter twitter team please do introduce the feature of profile lock for strangers as it serves like a privacy and data misuse for the profile holders
i have a problem with the protect your posts feature i dont want to protect my posts i want to protect who i follow and who my followers are just like on facebook and instagram i can intentionally let everybody read my comment without letting them know my personal details because i already locked them away please fix this issue thank you
is being a nice experience but i cant stream live videos on my samsung galaxy s and sometimes i will be automatically logged out from the app is very annoying please fix it
literally doesnt load most of the time and i dont mean just pictures but itll get stuck on tweets and it wont load anything else and it wont even let me like them i cant check my notifications or dms when this happens either
app crashes when reading group dms cant find a way to raise bug also updates are so unnecessary also installed uninstalled app still same has been using the app since years worst experience evernot even star worth
ive been a user for over years and my app has never crashed so much until now consistently over the last weeks i scroll for minutes just for my app to freeze and close itself to refresh i updated it yesterday and the same issue is persisting recent updates are making the app currently unusable only some have been tolerable for months prior
disappointing experience with the letest update the app crashes and restarts after every minutes making it impossible to use
with every update this app becomes so much worse the app freezes if you try using it while charging they introduced fullscreen unblockable ads that just keep returning even if you say you flag them the spambots got so bad i turned off public dms entirely the algorithm prioritizes content farms and celebrities over the people you actually follow the best thing you can do is never update
only sm im using most of the time from past days gifsimagesvideos are not opened properly sometimes app crashes whenever im trying to message someone
decent app but moderation has been mostly automated as of late leading to rule breakers getting away with tos violations some of which are tied to harassment and false flag abuse of the very system resulting in innocent accounts being banned for manipulation of some kind when in reality someone just spammed report accounts for spam and the algorithm does the rest the app itself works fine but until human eyes begin reading all reports and appeals again this app is far from five stars
despite allowing sensitive media setting to show all it asks for every post x labeled as sensitive thats very irritating and wastage of time user experience must be smoother
app working as normal but now i can not send dms since the update i can receive them but not send ive restarted my phone uninstalled reinstalled the app still not working
terrible user experience for you tab regularly shows up to six adverts in a row every second video minimum does not play due to a playback error previously the feed would remain at the last tweet read if closed and reopened this is no longer the case and the feed now refreshes constantly and inconveniently
recently the experience has been deteriorated videos dont load properly feed not getting refreshed while all other apps work just fine could you please look into it
terrible too many ads its just constant i understand the need for ads but this is more and than content and dont get be started on those unblockable temu ads
for myself and many others x doesnt loads tweets or photos while my phone is charging every other app works fine but x seems to struggle to connect to the internet while my phones charging
forces auto scroll on videos with no way to turn it off forces right wing garbage ads at you constantly if youre a man no matter how many you block only good thing about twitter is how many people use it and yes its still twitter
nowadays why x is behaving worsen than ever photos are not loading properly display picture is not loading videos getting stuck in the halfway user experience is degrading should we switch on thread
i can never get my feed to load forever stuck seeing the same two tweets and then the rest are either blank or dont load the sheer amount of ads is ridiculous cant go down my feed without seeing ad after ad
this app is continuously crashing and kept you on loading you have to wait for a long time even to watch your on profile page i reinstall the app to speed up and now i can not even login because now login page is loading from five minutes and its not opening
experiencing well sometimes not working properly dont know the reason behind this almost daily i am asked to sign in that cause a frustration a little bit my account is locked these days please look into this
what happened to no more automatic refreshing i remember there was a period of time when it no longer did that now it does it whenever it wants or after i exit out a photo i clicked on extremely annoying and unnecessary
what should i say about it this x is getting more and more worse to use or play rn after with ai function uhh you know and tbh i dont want to but i had to do this bc issues cant see or watching anything without login why do i have to login every time cant i just visit
always freezing always slow that makes you mad i hate this app edit it does work whenever it wants doesnt work sometimes for no reason i mean timeline doesnt refresh itself just tiring
issues with videos audio levels are all over the place with videos only seems to be on x app one minute ive got volume up full can barely hear the audio and next its blasting really loud be good if audio levels were all adjusted so they came out the same
its the best app takes approximately minutes to load a picture and business working days to load a video very reliable
perfectly curated to be as dogshit as possible as many ads and bots as can theoretically fit in an app will gladly give your data to advertisers willingly allows the most vile and abusive people to thrive literally coding for the accounts to be unbannable doesnt properly include fundamental functions like blocking further endangering any minorities andor victims in the app ive taken up praying just to pray on its downfall and everyone involved in making it the way it is
much improved experience the news it breaks here first almost always it will be the number one app in everything day like it or not get in where ya fit in
i used to rate now im rating it because the updates are no more in chronological order and they keep repeating the old updates its quite irritating i used to love this software but now its just the same as facebook
feed doesnt loadrefresh at all when phone is plugged in on charge makes no sense and is a huge bug thats been ongoing for weeksmonths
crashes frequently tweets frequently do not send without even going to drafts just disappearing search doesnt always work properly dms wont load site wont refresh while device is charging
absolute trash full of ruzzian bots crypto scams using elons face and now zero privacy features you also need to pay for features that are available on decade old forums for free such as editing posts source of misinformation tho
let me tell you this new feature for the blocking is gon na piss a lot of people off and not everyone can go private people make income on these apps please please do not go through with the new block feature for people safety leave it alone
i use x both on my phone one android and the other ios even though im using the same internet connection it operates smoothly on my iphone but on my android it cant even load videos and photos
needs a lot of work it wasnt perfect before elon but i swear they keep doing one bad idea after another the site is waaay slower the ads are everywhere things that used to be free he now wants bucks a month for site is goin down hill
still exploring and learning a welcome news outlet free speech platform and a place to find likeminded people you can use it to learn to expand your horizons and to look at cute baby elephants if easily upset steer clear of the politics
beforing elons taking over the app sending tweets was easier now it sometimes takes multiple attemps to send tweets sometimes not possible also biased cencoring has increased many folds
wont stop making the platform unusable and continuously violates users privacy adds are riddled with viruses and scam schemes utterly miserable to navigate would give stars if i could
the lasteat update sucks instead of replaying a video it skips to a different one or starts a commercial i havent found a way to fix this
i wish it had a better videomedia player similar to the experience on youtube but getting unfiltered news makes this an unrivaled experience news shows up faster and with much more context than traditional media platforms
app is not optimal but it is literally life saving hailing from a place of conflict zone free for all free from agenda no censorship just helped tons of places of war to show both sides a platform where normal people wants a normal life
x is never boring unless if you only know boring people and the app does not force things on you you will be in total control of your account its really worth it only downer is being automatically brought back up after tirelessly scrolling down your bookmarks
they disabled the block button from working how the app store and the play store both require it to work along with several countries laws requiring how the block button work no longer can you prevent stalkers from seeing your account and posts nsfw accounts also can not block minors they find following them anymore
this app somehow manages to come up with glitches that i have never experienced before never had an app specifically not function whenever my phone is charging truly innovative
since the take over the developers has made the app more worse crushes every minute and refuses to refresh the timelime sadly they dgf and seem to do nothing about it its annoying that they even know the issue and refuse to do anything about it just like their crushing timelime
every day for months now when i want to watch videos on full screen it never plays sometimes it even says playback error this is very annoying
i dowloaded the app opened an account but didnt follow anyone yet now am trying to amend the acc it shows i got suspended for what exactly now am trying to unsuspend it and it just keeps taking me around in cirlces fix your app please its infuriating the one star is just to get ur attention otherwise its a zero from me
your updates are getting lame idk what is happening but the playbacks on the videos are bad tha ads will even play on its own causing my phone to lag every update is getting bad so unnecessary
probably the worst experience from this platform on this app spaced with a lot of issues random time line bugs buttons dissappearing for no reason
i like the app a lot but i would prefer that it opens up back where i left off many times i want to go back and view something and i cant because each time i open the app it goes straight to new posts
the app is constantly shutting downfreezing up every day i get at least one or two sex bots follow me which i block now theyre apparently taking away the block option i thought twitter was bad imo x is much worse ill be leaving the app
how stupid the only way to get in is using your username i originally used my google account to sign up but yet thats not enough your two factor authentication is a joke maybe use something people actually have access to like their email or their phone number
im trying to subscribe to premium and i need a phone number go to add my phone number and it says my profile is restricteddoesnt give me a reason why or anything youd think a business that im trying to buy something from would streamline this process
i love this app when it was twitter now it is x since past days i cant open my account saying something went wrong you have exceeded the number of allowed attempts please try again later ive uninstalled and reinstall still not opening now i ve missed a lot of activities
please fix the dm it crashed everytime i try to send text on dm also it is very slow please fix it there are so many business based on twt and this is very inconvenience for them
i love being able to have free speech and i love the way this app is set up amazing job elon keep it up i hope this app stays this way every other app stops you from speaking freely not this one thank you so much
fix the website fix the video player fix the entire app i dont know what happened but after this app has become worse even with normal functionality someone who has no idea about social media engineering is prolly commanding the employees to make it worst
every time it updates it doesnt load and freezes after keeps logging me out of my account and will not load content after a while i guess your website is just as bad as your cars elon
the app barely works anymore nothing is loading and when the feed does decide to load stuff it refreshes randomly it just keeps getting worse i wonder what changed
there is something seriously wrong with this app now i have been logged out of my two accounts now it happens randomly while i am scrolling and when i try to log back in it says something went wrong try again later i couldnt remember my my username on my first account so now i cant get back to it anymore ridiculous
hands down the best place for current eventsnews this is the future the people giving it a or star rating citing instability or crashes shouldnt be allowed to operate a smartphone its clearly too technical for them
can not post anything using app for android been happening on and off for a week and today everything fails to post before and after update this used to be my favorite app but its become trash since changing hands its now the worst app to use
the app has been bugged for me even after a year of updates constantly closing out the app or kicking me back to the for you when im trying to dm someone the app is virtually unusable for one of its most notable features
was my favorite social media and my only one like before it was rebranded to x its not only about the name but the whole concept changed and it became too boring and hateful now i just open it once every two days and thats all too sad to see the downgrade of twitter in such a way
consistently crashes every time the screen rotates videos are still shots with the accompanying text playback error the notification tab takes a few minutes to load the for you tab frequently reloads and removes something interesting you wanted to check out in the older feed never to be seen again if your account is private spam bots still find and spam you whilst youre prevented from engaging in rd party conversations
opening messages and attempting to type has been crashing the app and its entirely random completely broken messages are virtually unusable at times
account just got hacked and they allowed the person from a suspicious ip addressiphone which ive never usedand allowed them to change my email then whenever i trying to log in stop messaging from logging in from my phone on wifi that has been same ip address since i made account telling me that im suspicious
the app never works its always buffering regardless of wifi or cellular data nothing ever loads the app is literally unusable not a single feature works
their is definitely some issue with x everyday around pm ist the doesnt work even when internet is fine other apps are working but in x feed doesnt refresh profiles dont open even spaces gets disconnected
if youre an artist your work can be stolen without consent the app keep adding update that just made it worse now the block function is entirely useless
app doesnt even function half the time at random times it will just refresh infinitely and its straight up unusable during these times mobile app used to be decent now its garbage
quality has diminished substantially since the musk takeover also please introduce a way to turn off videos auto advance for android users not being able to turn this off really drives me away from using the app
for about a year the app just randomly decides to stop loading anything and stays that way for hours or days the only workaround i have found is to load twitter on my pc and then it magically works on my phone
the ads are getting anoying the ads are now in portrait taking to much space and way way too much do you me to uninstall it sure i will
app has turned into a platform ran by a petty insecure adult each decision made makes the app more and more unusable unstable and most of all invasive how this app isnt breaking store rules is beyond me after their recent push of updates between blocks making people pay for viewing too many post in a day or best one of them all forced ai training without a single way to opt out best part about all of the recent updates is you can easily tell most to any star review are bots
blocking doesnt block simple as whoever is in charge made the insanely small brain decision to make it so blocking someone doesnt actually block them anymore they can still ser your posts just cant comment on them another horrendous decision to throw on the pile since the insecure musk took over
acceptable mostly but sometimes its real bad like right now i just cant use the app to follow people i have to open my web browser to do it whats the point of the app if i have to leave for basic functional
ive been using x formerly twitter for a long time and let me tell you its in the worst state ive ever seen it in videos fail to load with a playback error message restarting the app sometimes fixes this but its inconsistent if the video does load its going to randomly pause just because it can images sometimes just dont load if youre just using this as a text app its probably fine but consuming any form of media is a dumpster fire
any devs reading this can you fix an issue with android version playing video on the app is broken it just sometimes get stuck and says playback error and then i have to quit the app and start again also sometimes long videos pause automatically and keeps on happening and i have to constantly press the play button
for the past year or so it has become almost unusable wont work for hours at a time everyday direct messages also dont work often i could go on and on elon completely screwed it up
new review and its even worse than last time if i could give minus stars id give it ive been using this app for more than years and since that person buy this app its only getting worse and worse each update i am slowly moving to other platforms i cant handle the bot spams and too many ads back to back on my timeline any longer
i give x a one star because every single time i get on the app it logs me out or i get locked out and have to verify its me its getting really annoying if i could rate even lower i would
mobile version is awful especially for watching videos id go to swipe the time bar to go back and it just swipes the whole video away and sends me back to the feed page when ive been scrolling through videos for minutes can you just make it to where we can only swipe up or down to scroll videos the left and right swipes are so unnecessary and cause more inconvenience than anything
this app becomes more and more unusable with every update it shows you the same amount of ads as piracy sites it autoscrolls reels immediately after you finish watching a video and now musk is aiming to make the block function basically ineffective all to appease the billionaires wounded ego
twitter used to be good but the quality of the content on this app has seriously deteriorated and i have stopped using it furthermore the owner seems to be using the app to push his own extreme political views i would give zero stars if i could
im a freelance artist trying to make a living with my art and this app just keeps getting worse with each update he is removing everything instead of adding supportive features probably laughing at our struggles in the meantime even with my hardworked k followers there is little hope for me in this god forsaken place i have to start over and grow my audience somewhere else please avoid x at all costs if you can it sucks ss
freaking useless lag for nothing even after updating the app countless times loading takes hours and its just a very slow and worse experience it was fine until musk took over
ive subscribed to x premium to get my bluecheck for and its been a month and they still havent given me any premium features or my bluecheck and now they are asking me to pay another for the next month even though i havent had any benefits for an entire month im cancelling the subscription cuz this feels like a scam
great way to get news fast and real news too not the currated news that legacy media wants you to see believe consume news can be validated via community notes most importantly the freedom of speech is upheld freedom of speech is what has propelled the us to the greatest freest successful opportunity giving country the world has ever seen
definitely not facebook took a while to get used to scroll down not up you can block add vendors that you dont like or agree with so thats a plus spam is far less as on other platforms and that is also good
jeez elon you really did managed to tank twitter seriously though elon musks rule of this platform has done nothing to improve the preexisting features of twitter and has actually managed to almost completely ruin many really good features especially with the permanently hiding likes and now no longer allowing you as a user to fully block someone if you have an online stalker then you are no longer safe using this platform and its actually quite dangerous for you to have it sad
the moment i open the app to check the latest updates the app crashes and shut down i reinstalled the app but the issue still persist please resolve the issue quickly
literally it became the worst kicking me out of the app multiple times not even letting me postmessage not loading dms photos or videos even my internet connection is high and stable runtime exceptions and what not
love this app september th edit hi me again just wanted to let you know that i am having a bit of trouble trying to change my profile photo on my page it wont let me change it to a new photo keeps putting my old one it has been like this for a while now please do what you can to fix it thank you
replies to my posts arent reflected in the number next to the speech bubble symbol been an issue for past few updates unreportable catfish repost my posts unaware of these catfish until they were interact with my posts the removal of blocking facility is dangerous rather chronological order for default of replies this app needs to get the original basics right before introducing new ideas
worst app buggy since long multiple audio playing even if u switch from one video to another audio from previous video doesnt stop
the update has been terrible features that should work dont such as blocking which was changed to allow visibility the app now is worst
it takes too damn long to upload any photo via message this has been happening before and it is unacceptable when dealing with impatient users elon fix it
the app is constantly crashing and do not play media it refreshs itself automatically so the user is interrupted and consume the battery as well
twitter hasnt been as horrible as it is currently now images videos gifs take an eternity to load despite having fast broadband connection as well as a good smartphone
the app is now very ugly too much is going on i am only interested in trending topics but now i have to look for the tab i am already loged in but it keeps asking me to log in evry time there is an update i have to restart the app evry time twitter used to be simple ans straight to the point right now its like a website where you have to look for things manualy
sad to see this app destroyed searches come up with nothing tweets and replies take forever to load the app is now inaccessible for hours at a time everyday i now see racist comments almost every day my account had a bogus restriction label put on it accusing me of being a possible bot the owner of the app posts misinformation and disinformation everyday one star is one too many
too many pron ads too many pron bots too many bots in general can no longer block the inappropriate content for you feed just stops like there is nothing else to see and i keep seeing the same posts on it over and over
the layout is not optimised for android unlike the ipad layout which has been better designed it would be nice if android tablets can also get the same attention
this app is overrun by bots and despite only ever following art accounts extreme political content including transphobic and racist posts keep being promoted to me not to mention they are going to rip my art for ai training on november th closing all accounts by then and good riddance between that and making step verification a paid service this platform is nothing short of a dumpster fire
this is the worst experience app ever given normal image also taken minitues to load and hd advertiment loaded instantly and those are in auto play elon musk grow a spine and tell your engineers to fix this
bad the more it got update this app got worse loading loading loading even though my internet in great condition sometimes i cant even read a post because it suddenly disappear worse like twitter more the new update really annoying it keeps loading to new content even though im not finish scrolling down what happens elon musk
for years this app would have gotten stars from me but that all changed when he who must not be named took over the company for the past couple of months i cant even spend more than a few minutes on the app without it lagging and then finally crashing it really is a shame the app was serviceable for years prior but now its borderline trash
i am literally going to throw myself out the window right now elon musk literally ruined this app took off circles and a bunch of other useful features and now every time the app needs to update it logs me out of my account which deletes my drafts and theres no way to prevent it or get the drafts back this app sucks actual buttcheeks now elon needs to be assassinated
but i face problem when going back it goes to main stream please keep backlt sign and main tweet logo at distance so that choice can be used emotions are missing for me
ad central this app day by day is becoming plague with so many ads that even videos have ads and you scroll and they force you back to the ad terrible experience and my freedom is more important then giving up my identification for a check mark
transition both technically and directionally was seamlessenjoying itthe paid option window doesnt mention whether the fees are monthly quarterly or yearly one star less is becoz many of my posts are not getting posted may be due to certain controversial topics however the similar content can be seen in other posts
doesnt do a good job of filtering porn and almost porn like content with the filter on wish this filter did a better job but a great platform regardless
used to love this app sadly the bots are too much to take i hope you dont have a gambling addiction because they will constantly force you to be subject to ad after ad for legitimately and seeming illegitimate gambling sites
the feed has become so annoying now when scrolling down tweets after a while it keeps automatically resetting to the top of the feed
i wish i could give this a star rating since thats what elon and his company deserves the bots have gotten worse ads are plaguing both your homepage and in tweets which automatically play videos even if you got autoplay turned off people are actively getting punished for not buying their monthly service by burying you in the algorithm so theyll be harder to get any reach and the load time even sending dms are painfully slow i legitimately wonder if elon is trying to sabotage this app
crashes constantly becomes a stuttery mess after a few minutes of use freezes when you plug your phone in overall a worse app then what it used to be
a vast improvement functionality is typically very high i do feel like the algorithm has pigeon holed me into political realms but all in all a good experience
love this app i have found that i see breaking news here before it shows up in mainstream news app itself runs smoothly loads quickly and i thoroughly love the free speech aspect badass app
kindly fix the issue with wifi i donot know when connected to wifi this app doesnt load the data when connected to mobile data it loads everything please fix the issue its very annoying
ive been trying to make an account it wont work it black screens and doesnt create the account the support pages have no way to fix this its stupid
its easy to use and has very interesting conversations i use truth as well but only recently got a new phone so i could install its good as well but im not as familiar yet
constantly crashes glitchy has more bots than actual humans musk has effectively destroyed what was once the fastest way to get news in real time legit news sources are leaving in droves what remains is farright wing disinformation and hate speech intended to manipulate people into believing musks twisted political ideation what was once the town square is becoming a cesspool of dangerous rhetoric unsuitable for impressionable young people
i really like what elon has done with the platform thus far really allowing free speech and other options besides traditional means of information like the media back in the social conversation installs critical thinking and not being programmed by the powers at be it allows you to think for yourself and really research on your own to base your reality im thrilled to be back on a platform that is real
not a big fan of social media x is not traditional social media i liked the history sections on reddit but the propaganda is so heavyhanded there its hard to tolerate community notes end freedom of speech is what makes x a hybrid news source and superior to anything else out there
not what it used to be any new feature is locked behind a paywall the new branding makes it sound like some nsfw site the logo lacks personality and overall not worth signing up for anymore lost all of its charm and personality you cant properly block people anymore
i joined it as twitter december gave it feb since musk bought it changed it to his x all changes have been detrimental to my usage user experience it barely deserves the rating i gave it today the change to blocking is the worst freezes crashes on me a lot more now i only stay for friends here many are leaving im considering leaving too the old twitter had issues but nothing like the issues x has
pushes useless blue check dialog to the top of everything which is full of idiots search doesnt work rarely shows my things i want to see full of right wing ads terrible app now
constant issues with feed not loading or stuck in a refresh loop app stability seems to be going further and further downhill
constantly crashing videos not working and such strange glitch that signs me out only for me to close and reopen the app and still be signed in
you have to fix video playback its broken and it has got worse takes ages to begin also replies are not loading regularly
the app is very annoying it keep refreshing by itself every time you visit a post and go back to the for you page its annoying
constant playback errors on videos have to kill the app and come back in to fix then the app refreshed and video is lost
overall its okay please change the comment icon so we can view all the comments first before we post we end up having to click randomly to the empty space next to the comment icon just to be able to view comments which is absurd also all my followers are female bot accounts im pretty sure a few exceptions but over all bot accounts lol
removed the purpose of a block button making it easier for people to stalk the actionslives of others and theyre actively harming artists by making it mandatory to have their media be trained by ai horrible app with horrible management this app needs to rework itself from the ground up by someone whos actually competent with their job if they actually want twitter to actually be good again ps nobody with self respect or dignity calls this platform x it has and will always be twitter
came back to x to stay updated on whats going on better than search engines and other news sources still learning how to use features
does anybody else have a problem when they do an update it doesnt update anything it just makes it worse no my stuff morning when load im thinking about dumping twitter and going over to bluesky
i get my news here it lets the truth from different points of views be told now theres lots of lies and we must be discerning we can be fooled but the real thing with free speech eventually comes out its better we get to choose than to be told what to believe im glad theres x
constantly glitchy and as soon as an advert video loads the whole thing completely closes by its self does not work at all
i highly recommend this app for social interactions it is also a good place to get the news people are constantly discussing the latest things that are happening in america and around the world you will find topics on x that the mainstream media does not share or discuss it is a place where you can share your opinions and learn what other people are thinking about the topics that are happening in our world
x formally twitter is one of the only platforms you can express yourself freely and unencumbered that being said i wouldnt want my kids on the app but for adults that are interested in the real world and not what developers and governments want you to see than x is the place to be thanks to elon musk for being one of the only real ones to uphold our freedom of speech media and press to its truest degree and definition
dogshit app that decides to run whenever it wants despite having connection constant pinwheeling and have to force stop it trash experience on mobile
constant ads and messages that keep showing even if i said i didnt like that content so much racism and horrible speech against guidelines that doesnt get removed quickly if ever gone to bluesky
i sadly forgot what free speech was like on social media until i installed x but its been a great reminder of what is possible when youre not herded into a single viewpoint or canceled because you have a different opinion than the narrative being pushed which is what happens on facebook instagram i also downloaded instagram at the same time as x a few weeks ago and its just been a cesspool of garbage on insta where you see people doing stupid things and being rewarded with it
cant block people from seeing what you post and hides like function seems oddily specific towards a certain kind of demographic its full of bots and it makes scrolling stupidly tedious every single new feature they come up with is useless and makes the app worse x jobs are you kidding me who goes to a social media app to look for a job
okay this was the perfect way to get all the bots and disgusting people off of x ive never loved it more now that the obnoxious people are leaving it keep it up elon thanks for putting it back in our hands
it used to a but has really gone downhill since it was taken over and now with the block not doing what is meant to do i fear this app will become unsafe for people who enjoy using it but have good reason to hide from certain people ie those who are victims of stalking or domestic abuse
rapidly deteriorating barely works half the time and when it does work half of what you see are bots that pay to be more visible
mr musk has a genuine sincere energy and i believe he has the same passion for bringing back our nations true political system of being a constitutional republic taking away the much too long reach of the current tyrannical administrations who stole americas free and fair election and having the power to vote new laws that affect us the most and do it without our say so weve given top much power to the politicians and many times weve been murdered by our own government not safe
its the best and most reliable and best open platform not facing having to worry about getting banned or things taken down because it hurt someone who i dont know personally to be offended very noice thanks e
app crashes on opening up nothing new with twitter presently x notification never comes on time lot of spam msgs in dm flooded with unwanted or tweets of no interest poor ai
so glitchy videos do not open constantly sticking app refreshed randomly which means tweets are lost very bad experience
i dislike this app very much not easy like youtube this app gives you stuff without explaining how to use it im getting too old to be learning complicated apps i want easy apps that i can browse through
excellent social media platform under new ownership the biased censorship is gone and freedom of speech on x has saved the country too bad they dont have a st amendment in other countries british being jailed for tweets
broken phantoms refreshes the algorithm refreshes to right leaning or extremely right leaning but im just trying to get football news peace
open forums for people who choose to be openminded critical at times thats what brings me here i say what i feel and listen to what others are feeling good or bad i get a lot of insight into many subjects three years later elons purchased and changed its name the question is has it gotten better depends on how you use x imo i feel free to state whatever i wish do i offend people or certain groups of people maybe i am shut down on msn
musk is awesome grateful for xbut the app is soo bad with video of the time i have to copy the link and go into the browser it is just garbage
you can truly express yourself freely and reading other peoples perspectives is fascinating to me a learning experience sometimes very emotional love it thanks elon
broken random suspensions for no reason notifs dont come through message limits did i mention the app is broken because its horribly broken edit its still broken and buggy and now blocks are functionally worthless
i love the idea that it doesnt discriminate against people the talk about christianity its a clean conversation its a conversation of encouragement and you really find out how many people really love and are interested in learning more to fight for the eternal life and the big x dont penalize you for that pick up there a different things on here that if a person wants to get involved in it best deal personal choice and you feel your conversations are protected
actually i dont remember the last time i watched tv for news i get all the important news updates in real time on this app i love its community notes feature with verifys facts from fake news or narratives its indeed the global town square
this app has transformed into an adheavy platform elon musk has shifted what was once a highly useful app into a profitdriven space dominated by advertisements
algorithms for discovery dont work block feature is useless musks propaganda all over the app create a profile and first youll see is just musks bs pay us for just half of ads every few tweets no thanks what a shtshow uninstalled
i spend far too much time on x i have learnt so much from the news on there and even more sometimes from the repliespeople these days are so good at finding things out and letting others know what is happening
everyone should have this app if you have an interest in consuming any news media it could use more setting to time tune the app behavior and news feed preferences but overall its pretty good at what it does already
theres room to improve the free version but having been a member for several years of twitter prior to x ive learned though x just how biased social media is personally experiencing and witnessing the unbiasedness here on x builds my faith that theres still a place and a chance where our free speech is honored matters and more importantly fought for by both users and the platforms owner this makes x the greatest app youll ever use enjoy even with its few needed improvemes
its doing really good for me love the content i get i did see the reviews and was worried because lots of people said there was child abuse and sexualizationis false atleast for me must be their recommended content or they are liberals bombing the reviews with stars when they opened it but so far nothing like that has happened i use it for free speech and news updates aswell as political memes great app
grok best ai hands down anywhere you go youll get misinformation even books but this is not cnn research nothings perfect republicans love minorities with the economy cause they look like suck ups any other way
its simple for express option and post content hrok is accurate al helper its prompt to be informed can have group and discussion and space it need improvement when one wishes to change subscription google email
the new update has made the block feature all but nonexistent you can block people but they can still see everything you post which can pose a danger to people who are being stalked or harassed
updated yesterday when i open spaces the total app shutdowns as an active space host i couldnt connect with my audience this was on but for the last week i am again facing the problem updated the app still no improvement only getting worse
free speech is required elon musk made sure everyone has a townsquare that we can interact no matter what your viewpoint the app works great and new improvements like video blue and more make it easier to interact with the world trump
excellent app x has grok which is a phenomenal ai that describes answers to questions like ive never seen its like having a brilliant professor to answer your questions at your fingertips plus the people are great too
in another brilliant idea you can basically no longer block people you dont want following you sure you can prevent them from actually following you and interacting with your public posts but people youve blocked can still look you up and your public posts are still visible to them on the profile you have blocked
this app has become a right wing propaganda machine since being bought by elon the functionality has decreased to an almost nonexistent level deleted my account and app
suspended out of nowhere been trying for weeks to appeal but every time i try im told im not logged into the suspended account i log out log back in try to appeal again same song and dace cant even make a new account is anyone having this same problem
absolutely horrible shadow banned then erased without provocation or warning or recourse update elon musk allows free speech and i am back on despite not reinstating my original account if my original account ever gets back it will be a update my old account never given back and to be noticed using free speech cost money ill pay for my original account
changed due new brandind still like the app now getting worse as now cant even block annoying ads jesus its ok an ad but video ad takes my connection data and now add for religious scams
i love x and its ability to reach anyone anywhere it really is the new media premium subscriber for life and so worth it
no matter how much i try to stop it x keeps showing murder and death videos what is wrong with this app this isnt the faces of death no mentally healthy person would want to see all this
all this social media wants you to pay they want you to promote your videos or you get no views or followers horrible before i used to get lots of followers and views on my videos now only views no followers no subscribers not nice im sick and tired of this let it be organic like before we didnt had to promote we just used to upload a video and and the views were there but i know how it is all business no social media is free to use you need to pay they ask for a state id annoying
the worst social media app it encourages hatred and its very toxic i only use it for news and but i still see all the toxicity happening there every time i use it i get sick to my stomach angry and amazed
great app people saying its an echo chamber either havent been on other apps to gage or just are angry its notfar left anymore much more diverse opinions than previous ownership censorship seems to be mostly gone hopefully it stays that way
i love using teitter you can have healthy debateslots of different news and many interesting types of topics to look up i highly recommend it
constantly crashes lots of misinformation inappropriate footage showing on the home page from accounts i dont follow or interested in
best app for news real news without the mainstream medias spin favorite app to get the latest info easily replaces the mainstream news networks
echo chamber of low iq misinformation laggy full of xrated content and drivel a shadow of a fraction of its former self not really worth the space that it takes up on my phone
video playback error dms not working pushing rightwing extremist content to home pages checkmark bots in every comment section using our tweets and images to train elon musks ai and a constant decline in active users twitter as the world once knew it is dead and its time to start looking for alternatives
in my opinion x is the best of all platforms a free and direct interaction with people who really matter also a channel where you get the news first hand straight from the source
in uts previous format it was actually decent now its like theres no technical support or oversight
my account has been suspended havent signed in for months just logged in recently and im suspended without reason i have had a look at the reasons account gets suspended and i havent done any of those i hardly ever post anything so much for having a twitter account for over years to have it suspended now under x
nothing loads properly theres nazis everywhere and all of the half decent features are either being stripped down or away cant even block someone properly anymore
elon ruined every aspect of this platform it had an international nomenclature and was one of the most popular platforms out of the top it is now a garbage fire of bots system errors and nzis
can not retrieve messages at this time is the message i get times when i open this app never updates feed or messages
its times better as x now than it ever was when the other ejects run it i said at the start it was times better well i was wrong its a hundred times better and me i would say it beating facebook hands down fantastic job by the man
wish i could give it nil stars the ads are overbearing and the glitches are really something else im constantly getting predatory and triggering accounts following and liking my posts which is tantamount to harassment you go to block them and their content isnt something i can unsee the toxic algorithms and bots create gross ragebait and division as well as the leniency towards rapists twitter was ok but x is vile uninstalling
you get just about all you can want from an app like this if you want an echo chamber you can have it if you want a back and forth feed you can have it sadly though you have to deal with annoying people who just post whatever lies they want with zero push back but you can be the push back
cant use app half of the time it does not load data it freezes with older data and doesnt get refreshed while charging phone
my timeline is nothing but the ceos interests being pressed into view and vibrator ads the whole thing got so weird its a shame but what can you do all good things come to an end
latest app is so unstable its practically unusable constantly crashing restarting resetting to top of feed
the app features are top notch the outstanding feature on the platform is the freedom of speech i am the media now
always loved the x app still by far the best way to connect with people and engage i hope its move towards free speech continues keep up the good work elonmusk
they are getting ridhave gotten rid of the block feature which is not fair to people trying to stop stalkers harassers racists minors etc from accessing their accounts on top of that the amount of conservative and racist propaganda that is forced down your throat via approved advertisments while on that platform is incredibly disgusting egregious and should bot be tolerated on the app nor on the app store sad to see this from a once good app
it keeps logging me out with that and all the other issues described by users it has almost become unusable it feels like this app is just going down hill
great platform i was reluctant to come over to x but at the recommendation of a friend i jumped in and im very happy that i did its a great option to keep updated on current events
doesnt work as it used to not user friendly update stars you thought it couldnt get worse the block function doesnt work on this racist and all the haters words of a vile trash dumpster fire site filled with ads and bots
x keeps logging me out once in every two days logging back in is such a problem its keeps saying theres an error try again later fix this please
this is the place where truth runs unedited regardless if you like it or not if you dont believe me do a comparison between x and your preferred platform on a controversial topic x is where truth went for survival purposes
used to be a fan when everything was accessible and free now its just a money grab and a toxic environment im going to try bluesky as many have been recommending it
new block feature is ridiculous block should mean whoever i block can no longer see my profile and anything i post im sure this goes against my rights im also fed up of having to type and retype comments in private chat groups because of being thrown back to the main page almost every time i try to type a comment
i doesnt know my twitter username so i stated my gmail id after i enter my gmail id why its ask my username to continue its ridiculous if i remember my username why i use my gmail id to loginin before you send a link or redirect to our account without any issues but now its too hard to login to our account please fix this because of your inconvenience my account is suspended by retry to login many times im disappointed
i got harassed by different accounts and support still hasnt gotten rid of them coincidentally they all have premium so i guess it means pay money to break the rules horrible app
keeps pushing ads even when i block the pages and say im not interested a million times i block the phrases and s and still its being pushed and the app changed its blocking policy so that if you block someone they can still see your content
app works great sometimes the videos have a hard time fully playing but our starlink is partially obstructed where we currently are more that anything i am very grateful to have this free speech platform
for me its the best news outlet out there and the community note is really great when providing context of the post but one thing thats could be done better is the auto refresh thingy it keep happening for me that make me lose the post that i wan na see but other than that its really good
great app in constant improvement really needed to improve live stream interface this app is the pinacle of the social media era
the app has gotten way better been having a blast elon has helped save america main stream media is dead i now get all my info from x i highly suggest you download this app
the app is broken it doesnt load anything even after the update elon has ruined what was once a great app elons now throttling the load speed for those of us that hate trump free speech absolutist my a
app keeps stopping all the time keeps logging out automatically in middle of something bad user interface
the only thing i would change is id make it to where you can import friends from other platforms and your contacts its so hard to find everyone other than that i love x so much elon is the most amazing man
basic quality of life features locked behind a paywall ads glore not even targeted ads app doesnt always load first time the images and videos no wonder people jumping to bluesky when x formerly know as twitter is now bs
paying for premium and cant edit posts on android app come on x ive logged uninstalled yada yada yada turned it off and on again x just needs to give android the same attention it does iphone
it is a best social media app tried in my life compare to facebook instagram it has good ui in black and also high quality pictures when i wasnt download this i thought i should download or not because than i were using facebook and instagram that i were hasitating but still downloaded that was good dicision devloper make app more batter you are doing good joob
why cant you see the quote retweets man you got ta hit the quote option bout times to get past the nothing to see here yet tagline after a few clicks you can read em been like that for a while now
changing the block feature so that it still shows your account to blocked users is a huge safety issue now i have to private my account and go back into hiding out of fear of people i have blocked finding me again elon is an absolute joke of a man and cant accept that many of the app users have him blocked too
this app has been awful for the past couple of years does not load half the time videos get stuck
best source for accurate newsprovides some educational posts and its all fun and easy to use we need to make it more safe and limit pornography
i love this app elon has done a great job in making sure we all have a voice now dont listen to all the negative comments on the app they are most likely being told and paid to give it bad reviews
i keep getting playback error everytime i try and play videos ive tried uninstalling and installing still doesnt work
pathetic experience with latest version from last week you signed me out every to hours and then not able to sign in for hours as application displays an unexpected error occurred
pictures and videos dont load feed abruptly stops and wont load any further ads are mainly dropshipper sites and false advertisment for terrible mobile games
if i tap the i dont like this ad it should not function like tapping the back button out of the entire conversation because of garbage mobile game ads tapped from the home section does not make me quit out the app it disspears normally
very buggy app constant biased ads that keep reappearing even when you hide it used to be so much better
its ok this social media platform is much better than twitter and the others because there is no censorship if youre conservative the old twitter was a like a country club filled with spoiled brats who didnt understand that feeling something doesnt make it true x appears to have a larger collection of intelligent people but also elitists telling you you dont have the right to an opinion because you did or didnt do something
x formerly twitter is an excellent source of information as well as a great way to connect with some of your favorite personalities or organizations also since elon bought the platform x has changed the landscape of news and politics keep up the good work
i cant change my birth date and support doesnt respond update i had to create another account to see free content with my actual birthday and now the app crashes and there is so many reply bots
videos automatically play a new video after whatever i was watching ends no way to disable this feature
it works well but it could be so much better the algorithm is a black box users only have very simple controls
x was better before trump win lol well i couldnt see my old like they dont show after likes also whenever i open x it gets refresh automatically even the profile likes then like many other apps it ssk for money for some special features like editing tweet after positng so on
as twitter before elon purchased biased lying and damaging curating done by this company update elon has turned x around and i am revising my review it is now one of the few social platforms that permit free speech i am amazed at the turnaround and now fully support x in its mission to provide an open platform that permits free speech thank you elon
lol whats wrong with this app i keep logging in and typing my right password but it wont let me in error always i have strong signal and remembered my password i even saved it on my phone sooo annoying
i joined this app formerly known as twitter in february since then ive become quite addicted to it because of its userfriendly design and engaging features the platform makes it easy to connect with others stay updated on current events and express my thoughts it has become an essential part of my daily routine offering a great mix of entertainment and information
this app doesnt have a proper block button disabling someone elses ability to speak to you while still allowing them to see what you post is not a block button but more like a restrict button how is this acceptable for anyones privacy
disgusting app i am overwhelmed with the amount of self harm and eating disorder promoting posts i go to settings and filter out those words and there only seem to be more what is wrong with this app
twitter was and x is always better than insta snapchat for unfiltered information browser version too what you do with it is entirely up to you
possibly the worst rebrand in history gone is the personality and uniqueness of the bird in is the cartoonishly evil x and generic repost the verification badge has ruined the site the bots take up of comments promoted to the top due to the check the other is rightwing circlejerkers who would otherwise be ignored the app has turned into an utter slopfest and is unusable the final death nail in the coffin is the weakening of the block button into a suggestion garbage site
i commented that it needs an edit button in now it needs a free edit button if you have a valid drivers license and face scan your profile page should be verified and if you are spreading threats racist remarks or inhumane wording or imagery your page should be suspended completely no coming back the only thing you should be paying to do on the app is advertising products that are not fda approved people are trying to do business on this app not just sit and gossip
excellent its my lifeline suffer from bad anxiety and depression with brain fog so rely on it a lot its my only link with the outside world when i dont make it out
ive been off all social media for a decade at this point all because i saw the writing on the wall that foretold of a dystopian level of censorship and general willful ignorance among its users but now after seeinghearing how much better this app has become since its been freed of the clutches of propagandist traitors of public trust i decided to give this a chance finally thanks for helping to save free speech elon musk all true freedom loving americans are grateful beyond measure
terrible app login page doesnt work and then it says you are blocked as pressed broken button too many times havent managed to login for a while now
the videos no longer pause on their own but now the app keeps crashing while im watching videos
it keeps getting worse now people you think you blocked can see what you post great for stalkers also the timeline is still full of bots and trolls
primary source for research prompts news trends x has changed in a great way since elon musk bought it all for the better free accounts i like it enough to pay for a sub asap xs usefulness is dependent on your willingness to engage self manage be curious x has become the peoples townhall serious real up to the minute news often posted on location happening and intelligent interesting people with diverse ideas use wisely be private x is public
living in zambia ive had to rely on main stream media and have found it so frustrating i am so enjoying x it is great to get news from all over i just have to find the right people or companies to follow
im experiencing an error that logs me out every time i use the app for more than a few minutes then experiences errors attempting to login try again later
the block button no longer works properly it lets you see things from people who blocked you which shouldnt be possible because that gets around harassment prevention fix this or else
for someone who has lived through the era of left leaning and one sided arguments x is a blessing its a platform that gives opportunity to place a counter views its also a place where one comes across interesting info as long as one can filter through the bias rhetoric x has unified people of similar thought and opened the window of hope thanks elon musk for this crucial investment its an investment to correct all wrongs of extreme liberalism and bring back the needle to centre
has some bugs at times video sound can be heard even after closing the applicationworst case if it persists i have to restart my phone
the app works well there are still things that need to be done on the pc because the app doesnt support them but there are no real issues with the app its certainly much better than it was say years ago
app keeps crashing regularly on my groups very annoying when it closes down half way through writing a message
its still twitter to me and nothing will change that musk also there is no block function that actually functions like a block anymore blocking is essentially just a useless command that does nothing to actually prevent users from seeing your posts
officially got rid of the option to block you are unable to protect yourself from seeing an account and accounts are unable to block you constantly harassed by checkmark users farming for money and going against guidelines like advertising a gambling app bots who post porn to advertise websites are aplenty and now there is no way to block them there is no way for a young user to block a porn account or a stalker or someone bullying them its unacceptable
unable to sign up for an account it keeps saying something isnt quite right please try again later its become annoying frustrating please fix
i would be lying if i said that this wasnt the worst social media app ive ever used dont get me started with the problems its irritating now countless unfixed bugs this app was better before
hey i am a null client i dont like or ever subscribe to anything ever anywhere i noticed my for you is all from india for some reason i was not able to fix it so i had to deactivate my account and delete the app globally this started this morning at around am alaska time zonei hope the internet or x is not being attacked or whatever but im bailing out until this problem is addressed or whatever
awesome app i didnt care for twitter but since elon musk bought it and changed it to x i decided to give it a whirl there is so much information or there that the mainstream media doesnt report on we see real people sharing real experiences im hooked i even went ahead and purchased the premium account
glitches like crazy about once a month i can get on but nothing else cant see what notifications i have or posts not a day old frustrating
just removed app from my phone it sucks now and keeps getting worse was only keeping it to get local sports information the ads the trolls the bots the hate and the misinformation make the app unbearable
this social media site has really declined over that few years the algorithm keeps hateful posts porn xxx sites bots in my feed da i ly dont even try to comment or read comments because they are hateful vile or violent threats blocked ads but still got them same ad on the next feed or topic ive tried to report sexual and extremely violent posts but they are never removed not even sexual innuendo wchildren elon ruined it im not doing it anymore uninstalled
really slow loading and there are far more fake accounts then actual people also you can block and mute someone and still see there post pop up when you search something
x issues that havent been fixed constant refresh mid scroll unable to tweet sometime drafted tweet isnt drafted posted tweet are not post but instead drafted profile picture unchangeable
its the worst app ive ever tried to get into ive even tried the website it asks for username which ive forgotten and doesnt provide a way to recover it pants to x
the stupid app crashes too often i cant play videos at times and i wont be able to refresh my feed for hours
so far its great afterbdownloading x i got busy which affected the learning curve so still figuring out all of the features and how it unfolds
took away the block function bots in every thread glitchy video laggy home page slow to open would give stars if possible
bought by a billionaire so that his voice could be the loudest on the platform nothing left but bots and white supremacists avoid at all costs bluesky and mastodon are viable alternatives
basically unusable its filled with bots which boost themselfes up to get engagent the normal algorithm doesnt work because of the bots
i love x we share information education ideas knowledges to eachother through x its save and shares it through the world and learning globally and explore all around the world thank x
forgot my username after a year of being off twitter x now cant log back in because you require to have your password which i have aswell as username which i dont have theres no options in the help centre for my needs guess its partly my fault but i guess there should be a way to fix this without having to make a new account
i cant create and login and account on x twitter whenever i open the app it says something went wrong something went wrong all the time the worst experience of all time
up up to now i enjoy the freedom of speech although ive been experiencing a problem with the sound when i run videos on x
free speech is worth navigating the dumpster fire of ideas thank you for helping to break the strangle hold the establishment had on all news and media i do not know what we would have done if twitter remained under their control
if you want an actual block feature look somewhere else the block update makes blocking pointless and it is unsafe for those who use the block feature for safety reasons elon ruined twitter
its unresponsive most of the time keeps on loading the app and sometimes takes an hour to function disappointed
constant and incessant demand for upgrade destroy the joy of enjoying the application it is frustrating whenever you want to see new information
i was very curious about grok turns out to be useless as the rest of the so called ai that they are actually an hyper expensive chatbot despite that i love the platform
the clips sound always plays in to the next clip and theres audio files playing at the same time apart from that all good
dont refresh unless i ask its not hard if i wanted my feed to refresh every time i back out of the comments on a post then id refresh the feed its so annoying it never used to happen so why who thought that was a good idea
i have been logged out from last days and even i dont know why i think this app needs only money no needed community also they didnt give any clarifications on mail why the user account is not logging in i am using this app from last yrs its miracle after giving worst revive they unlock my account lets see how many days it will be logged in but i m not deleting this revive same issue happening again
this app is definitely the best app so far its transparency and freedom of expression this platform has really helped a lot of people to express themselves without any limitations first hand news and daily updates on whats happening around the globe
when you click i dont like this ad it ignores you and shows the same ad over and over anyhow blue sky is looking like the way to go
what the hell this is the second time i got my account suspended when i wasnt violating any of your rules as far as i can tell it got suspended because the phrasing was mistaken as advocating violence witch by the way i wasnt doing i made an appeal but ive been waiting for almost a week and im pissed at this point im just considering deleting the account and canceling my membership because it feels like my appeal is being slow walked purposely
after the changes the app is horrible to use why does the video player stop working at random times and why are the bots still able to spam comments
this app is a toxic sess pool all i ever see are far right adds which i dont care about also the amount of racist and misogynistic hate speak on x is unthinkable everything really went down hill under the new ownership which is sad because twitter used to be my favorite social media app do better
very very slow to use this app feels like using gprs in button phones worst experience nd making too much frustration
with the super terrible rating i was very concerned i would hate it but its been great its working perfectly fine on my phone im not sure why but i do like it better than the web version
opens up the world for everyone the experience can be quite overwhelming at times especially when you see or interact with people you admire i also enjoy fighting with other people on this platform
besides the obvious flaws with the deranged owner this platform is rife with problems all its own bots outnumber users in the replies accounts you blocked can see what you post now more ads than posts of accounts you follow just let this place die go elsewhere total dumpster fire
bots bots and more bots twitter always had some bots but now its all pornbots and a heavy slant to right wing politics despite not being in the us i have been bombarded with pro trump tweets in alignment with the owners wishes it would seem try another app twitter this aint
app just sucks at privacy and keeping itself stable move to bluesky if you want to actually want a more stable experience
i keep getting kicked off the app either after a few minutes or a few seconds its making it to were i cant use it can you fix it please
great app the best app for social media the algorithm needs some work but its getting better each day much better than tiktok facebook instagram and the rest no more censorship free speech ftw
i dont understand this app anymore it keeps logging me out i dont know why its so annoying and frustrating i hate it this app is so stupid and annoying why does it log me out always
this app has been the best for expressing opinions that i have used compared to instagram and facebook x has been more flexible with freedom of speech not perfect but much better than the aforementioned
i come here several times a day its easy to use and seems more open and verification of odd post seem better than before also joe average can comment or rebuff better than before
constant temu ads that wont stop ive tapped on i dont like this ad ten times already today and i keep seeing it im done being harassed by temu ads goodbye x you blue it
app keeps crashing lucky if you get seconds before it freezes then shuts down shambles
is there an option to rewatch past videos that were not shared if not is it possible for that option please and thank you great work team
its much better now not perfect but better that monitoring algorithm seems to be better but i suggest not allowing the krassenstien bros not be on the community notes committee
highly advanced interface with topnotch features i really love this app and i must say that x is my most favorite social media ever
love how people can now express themselves freely now without fear of repercussions only issue ive had is with the video playback as videos will often freeze america is back towards the right path and it is in no small part thanks to the efforts of this app to allow people to get news without the thought police and wrongthink officials getting in the way thanks elon
too many ads and a bad feature of auto playing the next video without option to switch it off
the app is fine but i tried the deactivating feature to take a break and i may done it like times and my following keeps going back down to zero is there a why to fix that
i am facing issue of sigh up after completing all steps at the ends showing error that something isnt right please try again sometime later please solve this problem as soon as possible
have to constantly close and reopen app stalls out has gotten much worse since new ownership very unreliable
keeps getting spammed with emails from this but i cant log in because i havent used this in years and i dont know my username when i do forgot password i just want the spamming to stop
its a good app a very active and extremely uptodate social network but the community is exaggerated and toxic i cant live without the app but i dont even go near the comments section
this has become my daily newspaper a platform in which individuals of various skills and background share news of all kindsjust like a newspaper of old
they permanently removed the base function of the block feature allowing people to still see what you post and say the app needs to be removed from the store immediately as this is in direct violation of googles terms of service
im having a problem subscribing to premium its been more than hours i paid but the check mark hasnt appeared yet and other services havent appeared either
what sense does it make to make a block button that still allows the blocked user to view your content its ridiculous and a breach of both safety and privacy id give this zero stars if i could
since musks takeover it has become much better but i still feel mad using it i dont like waking up happy only to feel like trash for having opened the app stars updated from star
this app keeps closing one me it says there are bugs but no other solution beside clearing the cache which doesnt actually solve the problem
works glitches and bugs have been resolved for the most part new features seem to be not as fleshed out or polished
i open my x message your app keep bugging and even i changed my x profile it wont change its automatically back to it profile even i changed it every single time please why you keep locking my account fix your app
im ip banned from twitter for no reason and making new emails or using different devices doesnt solve anything my past accounts randomly get deleted whenever i make one ive never said anything mean to or about anybody i always keep my accounts private because i dont want people to rage at me over nothing and all i do is occasionally like or retweet bunny posts or memes twitter is the worst company ever and i hate the app please can we switch to something else as the main social media
i cant log in because its requiring my username but i dont remember it i cant use my email for anything eitherthis is the most frustrating app
x is a place where all opinions are welcome and where the truth can be found x also contains various topics that people across the world are concerned with and that is why i choose x
its now filled with alt right white ideology and extreme adult content now theyve announced removed the block feature its not really a safe app at all anymore make sure your children arent on this app its full of predators now
worst app ever it closes every time i open the app and its been like this since yesterday once again elon musk ruins everything i hope this app disappears
its truly incredible i want to set up my account but they say there are suspects when i type in my number or email they are really bad
too much advertising too focused on revenue too many hate mongers on there owned by a greedy trumplican data mining which just got worse there are other alternatives where the sky is bluer
its fine but recently it takes about opencloses for the app to work correctly even while on wifi
what a joke elon fix this mess your rockets are cool but this app is just awful the free speech and zero censoring is amazing this app is just broken and when it is working x layout is just terrible
privacy concerns the new blocking update makes it so blocking is essentially useless letting minors see inappropriate content they were originally blocked from seeing and letting stalkers continue to be stalkers
this app is just full of ads and instead of seeing people i follow on my timeliness i see random ones and now the block button doesnt work like a block button ans people you block can see your stuff
videos wont load a lot more ads now people have enough bills to pay without buying premium on a social media platform
so much has changed since musk bought twitter very little news is happening anymore just a lot of political propaganda and im being shown antisemitic messages as in the discover more section its rough
constantly walling more and more content behind registration and login theres no longer a need for the app
the amazing community builders the audio spaces are like attending university for free their are really knowledgable people who have so much depth i learnt and learn so much about real issues and multifaceted views that challenges your own thinking too variety is the spice of life and x has it and so many features one trait that stands out the most is how informed you get about the world the good the bad the ugly
constantly having to uninstall and reinstall to log in frustrating af update cant deactivate my acct hate it
there is no freedom of speech on x for me because my sense of humor is deemed violence which is absurd they continually take posts out of context and call them hate speech or recently violence which is utterly ridiculous there is no one to appeal to because its the same people that label your post violence that do the appeals this is all purely political because leftists who threaten actual violence never get in any trouble so i canceled my premium subscription and thats that i guess bye
every change since musk was forced to purchase the app has made it worse the block changes being the strangest and least necessary while also enabling the worst people
my feed is filled with ads i dont like forced content in my feed that i have to block people i follow are removed without notice and way too many spam and fake accounts not worth my time
leaving app because the terms of service change on not being allowed to opt out of ai training and the other litigation changes to the tos is extreme bring back old twitter x sucks now
elon has destroyed whats left so move on to something better the app sucks and is clutter if you dont want your posts to train his ai well too bad hes removing your right to say no
the app keeps losing connection i can not scroll through my tl for more than minutes it keeps crashing theres is just too many unnecessary ads
i got some issues regarding suspensions and i have solved it recently that is why i deducted one star to make x listen to such glitches i faced with my other account otherwise x is best in social media arena
just went to goggle to get my password and they say it not right this is ongoing with x platform cant update my account it doesnt work blocked out cant get a premium account on this app
love the app just wish there were an edit button for our posts im always having to delete and redo because i misspelled something thank you elon
its literally unusable even for someone like me who doesnt tweet at all i was just there for the art but truly the appwebsite doesnt load at most times
awful app doesnt load after a few times opening and closing it just decides not to load for minutes
i recently installed twitter again not going to call it x but login takes literally forever to load so i cant even open it anymore great
i like the unlimited live but its alot of sound issues and glitch with the sounds dropping and the live drop you out of the space
lots of lagging adds makes it slower but in my opinion x is the media x us the power house x is everything and also where lots of engagement can be made
love the freedom of speech the freedom to be my gen x self without having to sugar coat i do hate that i have to pay if my post or comment is longer than they allow to get verified i dont wan na do all that i guess theres diff freedoms on diff apps i feel x should be complete freedom one of the richest ppl in the world is charging for more freedom to express ourselves kinda fishy to me though
the app keeps on crashing after the recent update it does not open only black on the screen
since elon purchased x this application has truly changed for the best im glad to be back on this platform without the fear of being lied to
since mid november i am prompted to login every time i open the app the login process just loops and i am unable to login frustrating beyond measure please assist
the app first of all is a cesspool but second it stops working if you plug your phone into a charger very cool has done this for like a year now
so far so good ive heard horror stores about x that are completely untrue great place for more information in not more accurate information
the app is broke filled to the brim with bots and nonsense advertisements and worst of all it is a breeding ground for idiotic nonces spreading misinformation and rage bait elon has dragged a once solid social media app through the mud and its worse than ever
important safety features now doesnt work properly intellectual property are in risk too the app just fell off
starting to get force fed far right posts that are outright depressing i reported a hard line racist post which i was told didnt break their terms i reported another case of targeted abuse of a single individual and didnt get a response after almost a month there is free speech and then there is what is actively getting pushed on this platform which is borderline dangerous it continues to deteriorate day by day
turning off auto play for videos do not work i did not update few months after tw become x and when i did it so many bad changes
it was better before when this app turned to an x i couldnt use anything i can not search see anyones posts and even mine it shows me oops try again
i feel like every night between the hours of or pm to am est nothing works or at least for me other than that i love the app how its setup
since the upgrade from twitter to x it scrolls like its skitters up the screen sorry i didnt leave it alone no option to uninstall upgrade
the new block feature is useless and fails to keep users safe the point in a block feature is to prevent someone from seeing and interacting with your content allowing blocked users to see your content puts children women and minorities at risk
the previous logo and name were way better the feed is full of things i dont follow the app is bloated and full of ads
you cant search anything lately on x to get accurate results you cant use advanced search anymore
targeted harassment suspensions hate lies all in one app cant protect yourself because there is no longer a block feature id give it less than zero if i could
the most useless dog water app ive ever had to use constantly breaking or not loading run by an incompetent buffoon who paid billion just to run it into the ground all while hoping it would make his kids not hate him now the app is filled with spam porn bots and crypto shills just download blue sky honestly
removal of the block feature is incredibly stupid putting women and slgbtq people in danger and talking away the ability of individuals to control who they interact with people should have the ability to control who iss invited into their space even on social media
this app is nothing more than a right wing propaganda machine recent weeks all i see are racist and derogatory posts and comments despite reporting and blocking them x does nothing about it and continues to show me this sort of content
a nonpartisan noncurated news source bad information and good information compete in the marketplace of ideas bad information is rebutted good information rises to the top free speech is fantastic
you can not see the post for hrs even and if you want to go through old posts and you clicked on one post by mistake itll be updated and youll move to the top annoying me every single time
this app got significantly worse since it got new ownership not only are there tons of bugs but there is an infestation of bots and unfiltered racismsexism etc that is allowed to exist
very confusing app not easy to use whats the point of free speech if no one can see you and communicate with you
its pretty good unlike other platforms where you get banned for literally saying something slightly offensive x doesnt do that and i love it for that reason alone
as compared to facebook instagram this social media platform is best it provides full freedom for right to speak on other hand other platforms are biased even after paying fees dont get blue tick dont understand how i will get it
worst customer service ever theres some kind of glitch where where you verify it wont send you a text message to your cell phone so you just cant get back into your account and then elon has a lot of people trying to sabotage him inside his own company i believe its the ceo he picked as long as youre small enough theyll delete you if youre conservative dont waste your time unless you just want to read post until youre big enough to say anything without being canceled
i am changing my review due to the new block policy that was enabled that violates our privacy laws in eu when we block people they can still view our content it goes against the best interests of the users and their safety
the only reason i use their product is a lack of choice they are a horrible predatory company that constantly violates both its users rights and international copyright law and commits what can only be described as a combination of identity theft and post modern slavery by having generative ai
cant sign into the app but i can sign into the website just fine please fix this i sign in with my details which are definitely correct it loads then asks me to sign in again rinse and repeat
free speech online again evidence based fact checking by all and no banning based on political affiliation like so many other online forums never had a glitch or failure of the app those that are claiming otherwise in these star reviews are just politically motivated opponents of free speech
this app has gotten significantly worse i am subjected to adult content i never requested the amount of apps has increased exponentially and the rise of hate content is genuinely world breaking
bring back the rss feed or some other way to organize and know read or didnt x pro is awful take a look at feedly or inoreaderbuy one of them and integrate
besides the bigotry cp and bots that elon musk allows on the site the ui is terrible the block system does not exist and occasionally the app will literally just stop working this is the nd time elon musk has tried to make an x site that has been terrible
the new block function isnt even a block people who youve blocked can still see your posts on the algorithm and its really creepy like what if youve blocked your stalker but then realise that now the stalker can still stalk your posts
i have a problem with videos sound playing in the background it wont stop until i force the close of the app
this app is not worth it you cant do anything without having your accounts locked or suspended or even logged out sleeping is even considered unusual activity now
i dont receive notifications anymore when people interact with my posts referring to likes and replies and i keep seeing the same tweets on my timeline even when i refresh
it keeps on logging me out every time i get on and then its telling me my password is incorrect even tho i just put it that yesterday and have a picture of it to make sure i dont forget
while watching other videos i still hear the previous video audio in the background and sports page broken empty boxes for scores
scrolling experience is really bad so many missed frames when i scroll through the feed it feels very bumpy
great absolutely great esp now that specific people have left for bluesky as with everything you get back what you put in
since last week ive been unable to post pictures from my gallery i cant send a direct dm too please fix this thank you so muc
firstly i give it a star but it has been very annoying in recent times especially like retweeting and following back have not worked for weeks now
barely functions as a platform they had some exciting stuff planned a couple years ago but musk has ruined any chance the app had of being viable
doesnt load most of the time and and if it does theres a bunch of rightwing ads that i keep having to block and hide but still try to shove down my throat
the only app i use now to get my news ive stopped using all other social media and watching tv news altogether best app highly recommended
great app make it so when you bookmark something it shows most recently bookmarked tweets as opposed to by date the post was made
app works flawlesaly and is highly responsive its elegant in its simplicity as well
x wont let me post replies and its impossible to get any help you cant get a direct way for support reloaded app and nothing works
they massacred twitter xpost xreply xvideo this app is just a political tool for elon to influence the american population now that theres only people loyal to him working we wont know what aspects of the algorithm is toyed with i can definitively say its a more hostile place
awesome and informative never liked twitter but x is a great source of real news in a true free speech environment facebook sucks in that regard
translate works less than half the time videos autoscroll to ads and unrelated content viral posts are flooded with ai generated replies
how do we find a particular saved bookmark without a search box bookmarks need a search box to find a particular bookmark using keywords
i love the design and how the conversations presents excellent the new media
nothing works timeline never refreshes videos and pictures dont populate terrible user experience rotted site
too many bots the algorithm spams me with posts i have zero interest in i used to enjoy it but now its not about content i want to see but content that elon wants me to see
since this platform has been rebranded x formerly twitter has improved massively it is my go to source for all things news sports daily talking points memes and social posts
way more buggy since space karen took over video audio continues playing over the next video full of toxic free speechers and you cant block someone now without them stalking you afterwards
the app is frustrating me i cant sent a direct message itll either crash and close the app or the message kept saying sending without it be deliver
it used to be a decent organized app now its just a literal waste of space on my phone other appplatforms are better now
removing the ability to ignore and not engage with the people youve blocked is the single most dangerous thing this app has ever done honestly dont know how its even allowed in the app store at this point
id give it no stars if i could if you dont pay the rat you have to deal with temu ads in a row and itll auto focus them you dont get any growth and blocking people doesnt do anything
this app might actually be worse than the youtube app considering some of the settings dont even change anything whether or not theyre disabled
i love x its the only place free speech is allowed but i will say i get tired of the polls asking us to answer with a or b i mean i dont mind giving feedback but its everyday and tons of them everyday
x is the premier social media site on the web no letter agencies controlling the information that you see like you get with any meta product the algorithm is unparalleled and the community notes are fathoms better than being blocked or banned for your posts fact check the fact checkers at x thank you for providing such a great product i deleted all meta products and solely use x and my life is better for it the evans family
video playback is broken theres no way to turn off autoadvance to the next video so instead of looping the video you were actually interested in you get a random video you didnt want also the algorithm for the for you section is seemingly random marking posts as irrelevant does nothing
removing the real function of block button is a real mistake the app keeps crashing too many ads bots exist everywhere too messy loads too slow
x has saved free speech in america i never used twitter due to its biased behavior and censorship now as x its the only social media platform i use i say this as a lifelong libratarian
i love x im also an avid user and i wish someone will see my feedback i just wish theres a mute button for spaces or even disable the space feature just on ones profile there are spaces that i dont want to enter but i end up entering anyways cause i saw the blue space thing whats even worse is that theres also a notification now to tune in spaces which is even worse please just add a mute spaces from someone button
regarding the app itself the videos keep bugging not playing properly at first or stopping in the middle suddenly
full of ad bloat revenue farming postreply bots with blue checks and now making the block function useless quality has gradually decreased over time and every update causes new problems or worsens the user experience
lots of ads lots of bots the autoscroll of videos cant view the likers of the tweets and now they ruined the block feature block button is very essential for me to create my own tl to see thw tweets that i want to see and hide the accounts that icks and now the new update took this away from all of their users im so disappointed to this app and its devs ever since that man bought this platform he keeps degrading it
this app has been deteriorating since elon bought it these new features and the kind of language that can be used on this app is terrible
theres so many bugs that hasnt been fixed like i cant see any posts even when my internet is good and sometimes when i open it doesnt even work and keeps crashing
ive tried subscribing twice to a verified xusers posts and was debited the first was canceled with no refund yet and the second is still active but i cant access the content i am still very interested in subscribing to the users subscription post any assistance would be appreciated
theres bug while staying in direct message group i cant stay chatting inside dm group more than seconds and it will force close and shows that x have a bug and they want me to clear the cache but it wont solved the bugs
love to see the range of opinions being expressed on so many subjects i also like that i get to hear from people not given a platform on mainstream media
the app works only about of the time now when not working i get a try again later message or just a spinning thing on the screen thanks for nothing elon
cant change my profile picture ive been trying for the last months and still cant getting shadowbanned and even logged off because they think im a bot and then you see bots replying to every big account and theyre absolutely fine because they pay money and now the block feature is gone i dont want to make my account private the block feature should be necessary everywhere such childish movements from elon even then people will not leave until you have to pay to use the app lol
it doesnt let me log in says something is not right when i try to deactivate my account it says password incorrect help option doesnt work it for no reason locks and suspends my account this app was great until musk bought it
becoming more broken by the day dms crash more often then they work especially when sending or viewing media been locked out of dms multiple times because of that
despite having fast internet connection on my device every app work properly instead of x after updating app videos and pic not load up autoplay of video stops pls do something and provide a update for this bug
so much glitch often one of the worst experience during a space and heavy network issue while using this app usually the server is down always needs to be spam free
im disappointed in this app since my timeline hasnt been showing what i want to see i tried interacting as many posts related topics as possible but it still hasnt shown up in my timeline
really dumpsterfirey after elongated muskrat took over ads pop up in terrible places feeds are random and populated to generate maximum amount of engagement between opposing viewpoints entire posts flicker out of existence the moment you make eye contact working really great there champ nice seeing this midlife crisis purchase is working out for him update block is being removed go to bluesky
the terms of condition is not fair due to the new condition regarding the use of information for ai training without permission additionally there are plenty of indian bots scourging every part of x and you dont even do anything with them
nothing works in this app anymore forget about all the rightwing propaganda being shoved down your throat in the ads tweets dont load media player doesnt work blue checks paying to get more exposure garbage
it has literally become unusable while also breaking the tos with recently announced updates its full of bots it lags constantly the new updates bring nothing useful yet take what was and render it useless
app owner is now banning and locking accounts of people that utilize their free speech too close to his feelings bot spam has exceeded prebuyout levels while organic content has plummeted and lost all entertainment communication value so much for being the town square app has been uninstalled and site is blocked to prevent any further corruption reaching me from this lousy source bye felicia
hi x team please provide option in the app setting to block adult content violent content this will greatly enhance the app x doesnt need to filter contents let the users decide what they want thank you
app freezes or never wants to refresh multiple times a day usually doesnt work for at least an hour cant do anything on the app because of it
recent update has made the app completely unusable it is lagging as hell cant even scroll fix it asap
elon musk has saved free speech no question even if you are on the left you have to admit that twitter was terribly restrictive the people running the two app stores were canceling while social media apps that they didnt agree with people in the united states were hating each other x is a beautiful app now truth social is good too but x is a gem
opened my eyes to how biased legacy media is when consuming news it is best to get as close to source as possible as well as to observe multiple and conflicting viewpoints then make up your own mind the x platform seeks to enable this process it aint perfect but it is following the correct principles and for that i am appreciative
ive enjoyed everything that i have checked out on this app i dont think that anyone or anything should take our rights of freedom of speech its in our constitutional rights that our forefathers have written and signed for all peoples in the united states of america but all in all i have enjoyed the app
the app is great but write now im confused why they start ads after every video you will see some ad which is same like facebook so because of the ads so many people left facebook so my point of view x need to stop these ads thinksx team for great app
best written contract ive read seems simple and straightforward if not wordy when you are trying to protect yourself in every way id like to make a suggestion and i hope its read because i just left a space that could use mass improvement using existing infrastructure and with that being said i will bid you adu it is certainly time for a vacation do you know anyone that knows babajis location or how to reach him life changinginformation and ideas how many x devices
literally the everything app and does it better than any other far left app out there moderate and accurate information with community notes keeping facts real and easy to check nothing comes even close to the ability and news resources in this app
x has turned into the only source of real news in aggregate of which i know a crowdsourced platform that welcomes citizen journalism and vetting beyond talk the name seems unfortunate however and twitter seems preferable
app is buggy to the point of uselessness the feed doesnt load or loads without pictures ads are deceptive and spammy app is unusable
its nice to have conversations without expecting to be kicked off i dont have shady conversations i was kicked off another platform for posting a joke with two booms in the road asking my girl friends if they were okay thank god musk is allowing people to be online and the pettiness can stop
hello my account is logged in and never logged out but after updatingupgrading x why show login even though my account is still logged on app fix it asap please and please add logout feature all accounts at once im struggling to logout accounts if i have to one account at a time
freedom of speech it took me a long time to switch over to x and now that i have i can not go back to facebook or instagram because of the crazy censorship x is superior because they honor the st amendment this is the best platform to use and not be suppressed obviously violence and true hate speech is still monitored and removed but it is not communist like facebook or instagram you can see all types on opinions from all walks of life on x never going back citizen journalism
x is the first social media platform i have come back to after years of leaving other social media platforms honestly it reminds me of when i first joined facebook in the sense that i have that same joy of discovery and authentic connection that i havent found in other social medias for several years if you want a place to authentically be yourself and genuinely connect with people without being filtered or censored x is it
app crashes constantly feed randomly refreshes constantly there are more bots than ever before and the platform is full of nazis wonderful work elon
i like how feeds play automatically my biggest problem is i dont get notified about new tweets even after i set up the reminder in settings update since the owner has taken over things working smoothly
x has got better over time there have been issues over the past few years with videos erroring and the feed not updating but it has got a lot better in the last few months and no real issues now
there are a lot of annoying short video ads and please fix the bug that caused timeline freezing while charging the phone
its the best place for raw unfettered news information and the only place left in terms of outlets st removed from primary sources it is not all mic free info but the platform is mic free to the best of the owners ability
since elons acquisition x is the only safe and free place left in the world for free speech and expression it has its wrinkles but its undeniably the only platform you should trust for news and information about the world its simple easy and trustworthy you cant say that about anything else in life
a true free speech platform currently one of the best news sources undoubtedly the most consequential social platform at the moment on earth the future everything app in addition its also very fun and engaging i fully recommend it to everyone
complete garbage app full of bots ai slop and farright hate run by a manchild who claims to want free speech but who bans anyone who disagrees with him a total joke that used to have a name that was its own verb and was used in conversation constantly but that got changed to be the most generic letter constantly moving more things behind the paywall and having worse and worse performance and it steals your posts to train ai abandon this sinking ship
very glitchy logs me out almost at will and often doesnt complete a log back in its been ruined in recent months undependable and cranky nowadays
another example how elon enshitifies everything he touches privacy controls gone every update breaks something new quality consistently going downhill and dont get me started on the rebranding what is this mans obsession with the letter x
very easy to navigate love that all views are welcome we only resolve our issues through open dialogue censorship does not facilitate open dialogue we have to be willing to listen as well as demanding to be heard
x has taken the twitter platform to a new level its the leading center for all of my news and info elon knew we needed a platform that was not biased and under govt control thank god this is what makes this country great freedom
in the last few years functionality of this app has improved drastically and strikes for ridiculous and frivolous reasons have stopped which makes it much more usable
theres long outstanding issue of x app still not retrieving posts message pl try again i have huawei mate pro with gb internal and gb ram and os and net wifi speed of mb sorry for reporting failure again
whats wrong with this app i have barely done anything on twitter and i got limits i cant like retweet follow or repost also theres many errors that i cant even tell it all i know its the most horrible app i ever use really bad
for some reason portrait mode keyboard no longer works also the new block feature is stupid
very bad ive tried logging into my account but states that something is wrong for over a week ive updated and tried several times but same
might not like what i hear sometimes but freedom of speech is important the app works fine these people are obviously rate bombing x for other reasons
this dumb app wont refresh the feed when my phone is plugged in lol i have to unplug my phone kill the app and reopen it
hello x team the posts on the saritapatel account are being copied and uploaded even from the past months i have already reported this account but nothing has been done this user continues to copy and paste posts please suspend this account thank you
x is the only free speech social media platform and i love it all other platforms cater to those who seek to sensor speech that they dont like or agree with but not x thank you elon for giving the majority of us our voices back
this app is now unusable doesnt load full of bots rammed with ads its difficult to find meaningful content comments are a dumpster fire just horrible
since the recent update my phone keeps reporting the app as high battery usage and suggests i put it into deep sleep
best social app without censorship and onesided information love it also love the aspect of actually talking to people and celebrities without it being an automated bot you can see and communicate in real time with anyoneanywhere
your app keeps crashing on me was it a recent update causing this i cant even comment in a single post anymore before im kicked out of the post please fix it
i have not been able to log in to my account for several days after solving the puzzle only the option to request help and log out are shown to me
hey team x just a small change or issue i would like to raise is that the trends or hashtags contain posts which are not even related to the topic this ruins our experience to get latest information to the hashtagsif possible can you use ai or program the app in such a way that the app automatically removes the posts unrelated to the hashtags
crashing constantly whenever i try to join a space constantly experience on this app is dwindling
searched for twitterx on play store got zero direct links to twitterx only direct links to facebook apps and ads for x after dozens of searches combos finally managed to force play store to give me a direct noad link to x
had a mostly horrible experience since i rejoined the app in september now they are changing the block function so those you have blocked can still see your content this goes against all logic and many rules when it comes to privacy protection it will now be gated behind a pay wall for the block function to work making it an absolute playground for abusers and harrassers to bully the people who have blocked them and still see all of their content which is or very much should be illegal
the last several updates i have been having issues where the app wont send posts with more than one picture or gif attached to said post takes multiple attempts to get posts like that to finally send
best social media app currently available because its the home of free speech if that ever changes i will update this review the video hosting is also smooth and convenient as i can watch my favorite podcasts on one platform without having to worry they got censored by youtube
a bit complicated to move through this app really needs to be made more user friendly however i love the info im getting out of it
i installed the app and was able to login but can do literally nothing because it keeps reloading and showing either something went wrong with your request or network issue try again later i can click one thing than i loads and sometimes it will close the app the app simply doesnt work
genuinely every update that comes out makes this app worse why would you change the block feature to still allow the person to see your account and posts and just block them from interacting literally what app does that why would anyone want that if i block someone i want them off my account not secretly lurking the senseless of some of the features are truly mindboggling
removing the one and only feature that makes the block button reliable is so petty like what came into your head to do that
without illegal activity my account is suspended and not able to file an appeal and not able change settings while changing settings it can an occur error and showing as like please try again
this app has gotten so bad if i respond to dms my responses dont show up and every time i try to change my pfp it never changes after pressing save im moving to bluesky
i have been using x for the longest time but now for some reason the started suspending the accounts without any reason also they did not refund the subscription amount even after suspending the account x is now just money making app without any conscience i hate it x id rohitc
im getting a playback error for all videos also i dont mind an occasional ad here and there but the amount of repeated ads i see now is just unbearable i like elon but i dont agree with everything he says additionally i think that the app is way worse with him than it was before he bought it
has become worst since a year or so spaces frequently break no voice request to mic when accepted gets treated by the os as a voice call and when u receive a call during the space both the sounds get mixed and u can hear both the sounds together overlapping each other also it changes the volume level to that of the call volume and becomes way too loud a well made app ruined so easily
after the last update sending messages causes the app to stop working and freeze they need to get a grip on basic features instead of changing blocking features
x seems to suspend accounts that are wrongly mass reported and has support team to respond to your appeals a huge platform needs human support since the ai support isnt sufficient and will leave you locked out indefinitely with no reply whatsoever not even a confirmation
i dont know its always getting refreshed without scrolling and the video doesnt run properly even if it is connected to high speed wifi fix this soonthis irritates every x user
i used to rate this app but recently it just keeps crashing ive reported a lot of times but but there was no fix time to uninstall
theyre messing up the block feature so that people can still see your content after youve blocked them thats on top of the general degradation of functionality but the block thing is going to lead to so much cyberstalking its a policy violation
easy to use search and get context on all sorts of news and topics around the world
not perfect but this is the greatest source for information yes there will be misinformation and disinformation along with truth if you lack the ability to discern perhaps stick to legacy media and assume its all lies because it is
its so hard to change profiles at times it keeps reversing my profile to its previous state instead that problem doesnt exist on the web ver
most recent update causes all dms to crash if you send a message with the keyboard open or type too fast or dont hit enter or randomly shoddy
twitter has gone downhill ever since elon took over there ad after ad after ad and it doesnt even work half of the time it just loads like what the hell and sometimes i cant even watch the videos it just says playback error
the glitches were getting annoying but then i decided to uninstall restart my phone and reinstall x app now works smooth and nice back to being a great platform
paid for x premium none of the features worked i found that i couldnt message premium support without a verified account however verification takes more time nothing worked on one hand i kept getting offered the ability to pay for premium by clicking on premium on the other it told me i was already subscribed google play told me i had to confirm my subscription but no ability to in x app or on desktop i tweeted their premium support no reply still took the money though
stop auto refreshing everytime i open x please make it stay at the same post that i close x before come on its so annoying im about to read an interesting post and then u refreshed the timeline and i scroll back that interesting post is gone
years ago it was just a broadcast platform for large accounts with the replies flooded by bots now it is actually a place to communicate and the pace of feature ads and improvements is incredible
videos lag and the audio from previous clips continue to play over the current clip i am watching
bring back the old trend for you tab it quick to get information the latest update was just terrible
takes lot of time to load pages images even tho my internet speed is good the x always lags behind and crashes lot of bugs
twitter has progressively gone more and more to absolute ever since elon took over its borderline unusable now not to mention you cant even use the app on many models of phones when charging your phone the dev team needs to figure that bug out asap but i doubt they will bc musks genius self decided to fire of twit staff app is unstable just a bunch of brainrot ai content promoted everywhere endless ads the incentivizing towards hit tweets at any cost this app is a mess
blue check made this app unusable rebrand is complete nonsense and lots of updates make this app even worse feature that automatically plays a new video when a video ends made me finally write this review
video play back good benefit from seeking related gestures and cast option to google or airplay getting to comments is hard from a post
sometimes very slow or even not loading new content when refresh or evwn opening search when other social media there is no problem opening contents weeks problem still the same
only been using x for maybe months never had an interest in twitter previously but after hearing that elon musk was trying his hardest to protect free speech i knew i had to at least try it now i use the app every day almost as a primary app of choice its brilliant i really recommend it for anyone
despite having best source for news and information its worst app in use doesnt load pictures and videos app just hangs and keeps loading spaces keep crashing
app no longer works as it should freezes and show limited number of posts aside from that it is an absolute hell hole now with no real protection for the end users
new ownership has changed this app for the worse theres nudity and porn on every single post theres blatant lies that are paid for to get more people to see them you cant watch a video more than time without having an add shoved down your throat
love x disliked twitter has some small issues i dont like most community notes some are good i appreciate being able to access unfiltered information in real time on x i like listening to spaces but i think premium is probably unnessecary and i dont need a bar at the top of my page for every space from every person i follow the things i dont like are not enough for me to give stars because everything i do like is over performing imo
the inability to opt out of your ai scrapping is disgusting block option doesnt actually block i cant believe you actually want people to pay just so they can be on one of the worst social websites at the moment
i cant open videos i always get the message playback error when im on a call or video call u like fb and insta and youtube where i can play videos with sound when im on a call samsung s
content great but unable to subscribe and no useful info from support with how to fix the issue follow up somehow the verification process changed and they messaged me a code instead of me messaging them now subscribed stars
the app does not reload or refresh even if youre connected to wifi needs to be fixed
horrible doesnt work well constantly reloads on its own so you lose what you were seeing crashes constantly horrible
volume levelling on adverts is needed is jarring to go from a quiet videointerview to your ears blasted by an advert video progress elapsed time or position should be remembered ie when returning to the same video after an interruption and losing your place
if you havent signed up for this app yet dont they are removing the ability to block psychos on this app so if want to protect yourself dont download this garage of an app its ruined you will be harassed by randoms online and they can keep coming at you unless you lock your account which limits the ability you have to interact with others
sometimes images wont load and i have to force close the app and reopen it it seems that the app doesnt have any mechanism to retry loading on network failures
not worth a single penny lots of bugs report function became useless noone dealing with it tweeting something goes wrongly under tweetsrepliesall in all timeconsuming name x without a blue bird lost the personality and style more than homepage content is either marketing or spam only profit is important the amount of disinformations is incredible no one checking no valid reporting privacy of users will be violated by new decision to unhide blocked profiles disgrace
cant play videos playback error for new update and and there a huge ads show and the loading is very slow is there something wrong to your server to many bug too and stop video from playing
the changes since elon took over completely turned this app to something near unusable and the soon to be changes for the block feature is just stupid and takes away its purpose
spaces either freezes never loads or constantly disconnects regardless if im on wifi or cellular timelime also doesnt refresh like it should and show relevant posts
i am so annoying at the stage of creating x account i am a new user and i created account on x but the thing is my account is locked cuz it said they have to determine my age i have been trying for many times and its still locked since they asking birthday they should know i am over gg
i was having problems with youtube deleting my post i downloaded this app and started using it and ive had no problems with x
unnecessary updates they dont even help the users at all ai heavy focus when it comes to artwork toxic environment very political that im losing my sanity for too many bot accounts honestly this is the most unstable of a social media platforms i ever use elon do better
i seldom have any issues with this app it is smooth and works well premium is the best feature which includes grok ai grok is the most honest ai ive seen it answers all the questions without bias or some bs that you can tell was human programmed to avoid the truth gun app for getting all the news and media that mainstream media lies about i love hearing directly from elected officials instead of bimbo news talking heads who twist the truth excellent app
at first it use to good i was really apliciate this application but now im boring with the advertisement and really hate the indian bot that always copy other comment and post a lot in quote that make this applicatin end up could you focus and please fix this issue please
buggy app always showing something isnt rightplease try again later no free version of grok like other social media i still cant verify my mobile number on x yet due their horrible policies
the app is working fine but in spite of all the settings enabled the audiovideo call option is greyed out missed call is shown in the message though
please fix the android app occasionally doesnt load anything when opening the app i have to close and reopen multiple times before it will update my feed and load videosmessages
app is very slow and filled with bots also blocking people still lets them see your tweets just doesnt let them interact with you a once good app has been completely ruined
not sure where these app freezes or app crashes are really coming from i have a pixel and it doesnt crash or freeze not sure if were using the same app maybe they leave bad reviews because of something else will this positive review be shown here at all
useless app only shows ads or scams most of the posts are from people i dont follow and the posts i do see are old seems like i dont see certain posts from people i follow
piece of crp my account was stolen by someone so they deactivated my account because of this ok but i changed the password and wrote to their support year ago to unsuspend my account and they have never reply i just wanted my account back but now i dont want even to use this social network
search tab now become a nonsense none of my word appear on in it sometimes we cant see the quotes bugs here and there and the annoying parts are too much like literally too much spam from socalled blue checkmark account
quick easy news verifiable and it doesnt try to waste your time with reading whole articles with subscriptions paywall but you can get lost and get tunnel vision echo chamber which is not good
great app but please fix that this app stops streaming a space when the display turns off it used to work fine two weeks ago
app is getting worse and worse with time the auto playing ads have gotten so intrusive that they sometimes even auto play the last video you watched on the discord app somehow
videos auto scroll to the next cant disable it on android but you can on ios for you tab randomly refreshes while youre reading dont need another doomscrolling tiktokinstagram time waster
social media has been due for some major changes for a very very long time x is leading the way into and beyond and the rate at which they are changing things is nothing short of epic in addition ld like to personally recommend x premium for anybody that takes their online presence and social media seriously i signed up for it in may with low expectations and was ecstatic to become monetized by july and just now they turned my subscriptions on x premium paid for itself and then some
content is great when it works this is the only app i use that continues to freeze spin not update etc whats going on have to restart my phone and hope that works updated cant use it this morning because its stuck on yesterdays last view nothing will play or open i have a newer phone and every other app works fine
i am beyond thrilled with what x has become i have become a subscriber grok is the best ai ive used it gives deep details about whatever you ask of it x has turned into the main social platform i use now i look forward to all other avenues that comes out of x may it be the one app to rule them all
it keeps logging me out for suspicious activity when i dont even post and one mostly commenting on others post it wont let me verify my number and it asking for me to send a message to a country code for otp that im unable to send sms to and what with the every min authentication puzzles
my account is behaving as if it is limited but i violated no terms elon musk unblocked his account without my consent so i could see his posts i cant follow anyone new due to reaching a limit i have not even reached i have been forcibly unfollowed from accounts i was following i can not reply to posts i can not post when i repost something my likes and bookmarks go away on that post and i have to relike and rebookmark them the left is being suppressed on x
i havent paid for anything yet i like that i can get news on x that i cant get anywhere else i like that certain posts come with disclaimers as with any true speech platform one has to really investigate what is real and what is a deep fake
it is the best place to get latest news thats happening in this world the best thing of x is that we can see different view of many people without censorship x is really only thing out there that allows free speech it has its downside but this best thing we got community note concept is best thing this platform put in place like no one can claim something that not true and not get community note
keeps getting better i appreciate the value proposition as the services expand anyone complaining the app is bricked or crashing check your other installs because i have not had this app crash in the years i have used it not once was running on a pixel until september
hey x whats wrong with you why are you constantly sending me the notifications like xxx sixy porn i didnt even open and used that account since i downloaded app and neither i watch this type of content this is my worst experience ever compared to any app like your algorithm is pushing vulgurity among audience
very buggy since the brand change the app keep getting force closed every so often when i try to open direct message video quality is really low too
would be nice if errors would give more detail username could not be changed at this time it leaves thinking okay why not should i just try again in an hour do i reinstall whats going on so having more detail in the errors would be nice
yes this app sometimes it bugs out at night times only x is definitely better than facebook instagram snapchat and other apps its started to replace youtube too due to the fact i follow everyone on x and they post same things on there
recent update makes me not want to use twitter anymore the new auto play function is nothing but annoying since it either spams ads or break the video needing a full restart of the app i also dont get why anyone would want an auto play when i click on a post i want to look at that post not random videos and now im seeing more ads than actual posts while scrolling to a ratio of or ads for every post hoping they fix and revert these changes or im just going stop using twitter
the x app is cool i love reading interesting stories on there but the topics just got less and less about your preferences which can be annoying but they are doing the best they absolutely can keep up the great work guys dont worry be happy
got my account suspended cant log in to appeal it and received no other information i have maybe at most posts that as far as im aware dont break the rules attempting to sign in only provides an error or redirects back to the previous page
i like that you can ask questions directly to the person and get a response from themor think its really them being able to see all that that is going on in space is awesomeonly thing i dont like is showing all the fights and assaults going on in schools think that kids see enough we dont need to put it on social media so kids can see it and be like hey we should do that tohope im not wrong for saying this
this app is poorly moderated disappointing moderating is important for every single app i recall on another app trying to write a text for my bio and they moderated my text that i wasnt able to upload text people are claiming racism and homophobia is let on the app people finding violent post with no censorship just not good the block feature removal that will be set will create issues for some people dont recommend and have no interest in this app
its better than i remember twitter being more features more to explore features really built out still looking for good real good people the parody accounts are annoying
this app has gone to the dogs tl wont load half the time posts dont get posted videos wont load photos wont load just keeps adding useless features nobody asked for
the data storage has grown huge and i cant move it to external storage privacy controls are always changing
the app barely works anymore every update causes more issues media doesnt load but adds magically do feed doesnt refresh and stays the same for hours just useless
the app will periodically force log me out try to make me sign back in with a google account in these times it wont recognize me login password the only workaround has been to uninstall reinstall the app on top of elon turning it into a cesspit to peddle bigotry misinformation now hes about to violate the play stores tos in regards to the block button
app barely works elon has officially ruined twitter and no im not calling it x images never load constant bugs bot accounts are everywhere their subscription service promotes spam hateful content and clickbait and elon himself is just a terrible person barely deserving star
the new terms of service update automatically uses your posts to train ai you can opt out only if youre in europe or places with such strong regulations this app keeps worsening since elon musk arrived its packed with ads and it keeps crashing as well
elons continuous updates meant to make the app less usable and more preferential to racist misogynistic queerphobic scum have been happening for a while but the newest one that allows blocked users to still see posts is outright dangerous for people who are the victim of stalking and harassment utterly horrific update
recently all the time i open the app it makes me log in again so frustrating and pointless the dms keep crashing and crashes the app and closes it
sadly after buying premium it shows as needs confirmation theres no support line to contact this is my rd time having this issue and im starting to doubt that i can even subscribe to this service now need help immediately
the space nonce is trying to make this app unusable the only videos that actually can be played are the adverts which are every second post
too many rightwing stories are ruining the experience for me im not political at all and these ads and stories are definitely having the opposite effects that they are intended to cause
i am facing problem even after verifying my twitter account reach is out i even logged out for hours and unstalled i did the same but the same problem is coming again i stopped seeing ads and twitter stopped my payout so what review should i give you i have subscribed to your app twice and i am in loss to no avail please check my account and help me
not a free speech platform you will be banned support will be completely unavailable and if you do manage to finally get in contact with a human they will be rude and unhelpful they will also refuse to rectify payment issues to the app do not give these snakes your money
i love the app the way you can connect with various brands or state your opinion however not being able to verify for premium upgrade so giving only stars
do your job better so many bugs overall both ios and android impossible to submit a report and no ts fixes it actually check and fix stuff
the new feature of block is unaccepatable the application will allow the blocked account to see any post or content of the bloker moreover the application also is violation of personal rights by focing to use users contents for training ai
this app is so broken its not even funny video playback direct messaging notifications even making a post its all glitchy it all fails every update makes this app worse
resolve the issue whenever app releases it update then from that time onwards i started facing app login failure even though i have updated it unless i have to reinstall the app for fresh login these issue i had been facing from past three updates
dear elon the x team is being paid to do nothing they do not review suspended accounts when using a new account all actions leads to it being locked or suspended i dont even see a point in using this app anymore it just gives me brain damage please do something to make this app usable again thank you
app keeps crashing i cant respond to dms at all without the app freaking out and closing no updates have solved this issue within the last month
came back to x now that it is no longer twitter but now after using x for nearly a month it will not let me sign in because evidently it or someone is using my email address making x tell me that my email is on another account so much for almost enjoying this platform
not trying to be rude or anything but it keeps making me stuck at the username part no matter how several tries i have even the verification code couldnt reached in as well even though it was verified please fix up
the app is lagging and u will need to pay at least the smallest subscription to be seen by real people and not bots i got banned for no reason simply by posting links for an upcoming airdrop of well known crypto project causing me a loss of k followers account more than years and the app does not have even a chat agent support just bunch of automated bots that they dont even answer to your problem its a total joke why should someone even pay for that
so there is alot of porn on this app also alot of scammers and bots that need to be taken down as well the app is grate how ever there are many predators on the app as well ive reported plenty and many more to come i hope elon musk takes care of it as well
i finally found the issue after years of having the same problem the app glitches really bad if i want to use it while my phone is charging most of the times when i open the app while charging its like frozen and all in grey i have to close it and reopen it again to see if it loads up but it still keeps doing the same thing please fix this issue as i have been dealing with this for more than a year now thank you in advance
worst user experience coz ive been facing so many issues after the app changed to x some of them are two videos simultaneously play at one time on the feed videos doesnt load properly even though i have g or wifi with fast internet the media doesnt load at the highest quality available the feed refreshes on its own sometimes and so many ads which are irrelevant to me
x now screams money speaks louder than words is basically not any different from other money grabbing applications filled with ads and premium offers i really miss twitter maybe its now time to switch to a different platform built for regular consumers
from last week the videos are no running well they only show buffering once after every second please fix the issue as soon as possible
since i updated to the latest version on my android phone it took me more than a minutes to send dm its hard to send the dm since the app keep lagging whenever i try to send dm please fix this asap
keeps failing and stop loading content for hours happens twice a day at night and in the morning
most of the times photosvideos wont load sometimes when videos starts playing it stucks in half way through help center is good for nothing
there is no way to complain about the newsfeed not showing or slow loading while every other app n internet works really fast on phone uninstalling it as it takes too much time to load content
im a unique individual im illiterate with disabilities the few abilities i have dont help me to make large sums of income if any i have abilities to see things differently i notice elon rarely responds to people not saying he can respond just saying he rarely does i wish i wasnt poor put thats a fairy tail for a different story x is doing just fine
the app often just sits on loading when i open it and nothing will happen when it does load i suffer through the awfulness of what elon musk has done to the app with a few things i actually enjoy here and there in between the garbage
very slow loading under new management there are way too many porn bots violent and graphic content goes unchecked and is without warning hate speech runs rampant so much false political information elonmusk has ruined the experience
the app completely shuts down like every day im a big fan of the changes made in censorship but the app is insanely unreliable and glitches or fails to load videos posts or refresh the timeline multiple times a day every day its been persisting for months and there is no option in the help center or the contact tab to report technical problems
video player working is hit or miss and it is not uncommon for the app to fail to load my feed broken update also important to note that trying to view your feed while charging your phone completely breaks the app with no content being able to load same issues still persist and now they added auto scrolling for videos idk who made that decision but its terrible extremely anti user as it makes watching videos on my feee more of a pain than it already is
i got a little popup that the block part is getting changed so someone you have blocked can no see your account just not engage i personally dont like it so it ruined the app for me
roll back the new changes regarding the block feature its of absolutely no use if those blocked can still see a users posts pathetic just makes the online space more unsafe discard it undo it roll it back
great app to catch up on the world if you dont watch the news like me but im having a problem trying to change my pfp everytime i try to change it it changes back to my old one so am i stuck with my current pfp or is this just a bug and can it be fixed
theres a bug where ill try to text one of my friends and it just freezes everything and doesnt let me text them or anything at all but when i text another friend it works fine
lots of new useless feature and keep bugging so im editing to star ads are also everywhere and some are annoyingly long to scroll past more blue check commented unrelated thingsstealing comments or straight up making bait post to gain interaction and since theyre always top on the reply section it look like its filled with bots instead and now forcing users to agree to their tos bcs they need to train the dumb ai and everyone have to agree
great now i can get stalked again d thats what i wanted thanks elon give us the actual block back there are reasons why we block people like not wanting to see their content
i absolutely have no trouble with the app at all does exactly what its expected to do maybe the others are expecting it to cook clean and run errands while they keep their beds warm
new features are weird and violate user privacy one of them is change of block feature according to x official account it was announced that if your posts are set to public accounts you have blocked will be able to view them but they will not be able to engage no matter one sets their posts public or not blocked accounts are not supposed to be able to view the posts at all if change of block feature lingers to take effect x will then violates google play stores restricted policy
videos random playing in the background even when force closing twitter the app is falling apart because he fired all his engineers move to threads its better
recent updates ruining the experience hate how when a video ends its autoplays a new one no way to turn it off hate how ads cant be blocked now im so sick of seeing ads for temu these changes are genuinely so annoying im hardly using the app thats probably for the best at least bluesky exists and has been a joy to use instead
it has become the best source of news and a great place for intelligent conversations and just like any elon musk products it keeps improving on a daily basis
terrible terrible terrible ever since elon musk came at head of the site every feature added made the site worse and now the block feature encourages stalking since blocked people can still see your posts also ai using your posts whether you like it or not bad bad bad
automatically scrolled up video after one is done watching is not the update that needed tho no one wants it please
there is lots of problems we are sharing things then why you logout our idwhy is this app i think to share thoughts news etc but if we are using lot then you will suspend it why space issue suspension without any solid reasonafter last update its going worst
apartheid clyde destroyed the app crypto ads everywhere xweets not loading videos glitching cant see xweets from ppl i follow blue check monsters xweeting horrific things and using our posts to train ai disgusting
i have facing continuous issues regarding loading tweets photo and videos havent open despite having strong internet connection not expected this from x please fix this problem
video probably issues often removing features broken feed crashing often app feels as though its on life support
x is very fascinating its one of best digital media platforms ever since joining this app my experience has been completely fantastic and i overemphasize just how exciting it has been for me over the couple of months great job elon kudos to you and your entire team
ive been using this app for years now and it has gone down hill every since the new ownership took over i have to restart the app multiple times as tweets do not load pictures videos or any larger size posts especially ads are terrible i will see or of the same ad in a row not even the same ad further down but literally the exact same ad times in a row on my timelime its a chance the ad will be for something like industrial farming automatic volume on ads should be a crime
as always implementing useless features that literally no one asked for the newest one being the auto next video now instead of a video playing on a loop until you choose to swipe up the video auto swipes to the next video seriously remove this or add a toggle to either turn it off also why does this app always auto refreshes open the app auto refresh scroll decides to auto refresh extremely poor attention to detail by the x team
as of a few days ago the app is constantly crashing anytime i try to message someone this app has slowly turned into a complete piece of garbage
this app only promotes user with badges and doesnt give a damn to non badge users if i reply to someone it has a one in million chances to be actually on top if i tweet something it never gains damn views while scrolling a random video will continue to play even if i have scrolled down
intuitive user friendly never had any problems with the app x and rumble are among the few platforms that do not censor speech and do not serve as the propaganda wing of the tyrants
i normally use the app to find art its great for that but its also a very toxic app someone is always looking for ways to start problems
this is about the android app facing this issue for many years hoping this will improve app freezes and will not refresh need to force stop the app and reopen for it to work ive tried clearing cache works sometimes nonetheless expected this to improve over time but it just doesnt
do not download this app can use any content you own without permission and without paying you what you create there can also be used to by the company for their ai theyre also planning to change the block feature where you cant even hide your post from stalkers and the like anymore a horrible app ruined by the one and only elon musk being egotistical
videos are not playing properly and pauses itself timeline refresh often when reading a post and much more bugs in the software in last update
block feature has been ruined this app was already garbage in the overall user interface but the block feature changes made it unusable and unsafe to use
i used to enjoy the app until recently when i am constantly logged out due to an error at the moment i cant access my account anymore kindly look into this and id give my ratings back
the worst app ever as if u dont use x for few hours again e have to login prove our identification they lock accounts themselves without our permission without no clue to the user again and again they logout and we have to give identification better use some alternative apps this is the worst app
x has been very frustrating of late it logs me out of my account very randomly and very frequently without any reasonable reason for doing so this has got to stop
every time i watch a video now since the last couple of updates at the end of the video it scrolls to another video instead of stopping like it used to of the time it goes to a black screen and then locks up i have to sreen lock my phone then log back into it and close the app why does it now scroll to another video and why cant i turn that off
x is the best app for all of the information you could possibly want x has been the most reliable source of current events that i have ever used gladly subscribed
this app has been broken for more than a year i havent been able to change my profile picture in the app since last year theres more bots than ever
same consistent problems everyone else says itd be nice to see some type of improvement in the app or at least with the glitches
twitter is completely unsafe you can no longer properly block people if you use block you stop users interacting with you but they can still see your tweets so can still screenshot you and use that screenshot its become a stalker and abusers paradise it also breached the play stores own rules and european law x should be removed from the play store because of this
since the update it wont reload and is completely unuseable its no longer a good app and constantly crashes probably going to delete and use better social media platforms
this app has become basically unusable i will load the app up and it works for a bit bit then itll randomly freeze then itll scroll in little spurts like its trying to keep working but it just freezes up again and makes my phone lag i had to force the application to stop and even after doing so my system ui started to have an issue but only after the app crashed never had this issue with any app also getting to ads back to back in insanely annoying
the app constantly fails to respond the timeline doesnt refresh for what seems like hours then suddenly works images and videos fail to load all the time force stopping and clearing the cache doesnt help correct the problem it performs so badly i thought incorrectly that the problem was with my wifi connection however it still doesnt work on a mobile connection its terrible
its like every since the switch to x my feed and notification sections just refuse to load half the time i cant interact we oth the posts i cant scroll because the other ones dont load idk what it is its like it picks and chooses when to work i have to go to my browser to check my stuff when that happens and it can last hours
please fix your app updates later still no fix profile picture is always glitched out and just wont change been doing this for months still somehow hasnt fixed it updates later still hasnt been fixed i have to keep redoing it over and over and over and rename the file and sometimes it still does not work
twitter x will be reducing the capabilities of the block function this violates googles tos increases the likelihood of safety violations on xs platform as someone who used to have a stalker i find this to be a pressing issue that might lead me and others with similar concerns to danger
android version of x is too bad lately app freezes frequently doesnt load new contents randomly its not the same as before
welp its official elon has officially screwed this site over all i see is ads and misinformation being spread around while he does nothing not only that but messages have become completely unusable because of how much it crashes
within the past couple months ive noticed a decline in quality every time i open the app it will not load i have to restart it multiple times sometimes it will never get back to normal and ill just give up ill have the first couple posts on my feed available to me but i cant like bookmark or retweet if i open a picture or video it will not load
it just gets worse videos have started automatically moving on to some random other video so you have to back out before it ends they also made a change that gives access to your data to some random ai nonsense and you cant turn it off in the app you have to go through the website
yes its a good way to keep up with your x account friends and the like but my one problem is the varying load times on some days its snappy and quick to the point but on others it can take at least or more to finally see the content i know that may not come across as a big deal to some people but it can even effect the most vital functions of the website such as processing your post to be seen by all otherwise good app but i prefer to open x on the web
theyve quickly been making ads more intrusive it used to be between every three posts there was an ad sometimes i now get five ads in a row block an account thats posted an ad and refresh your page guess what the next ad you see is absolutely awful app the art community that had built up so strong is dying because of the engagement changes smaller accounts get nothing unless they pay disgusting shameful and downright wrong i would give less stars
there are too many ads after scrolling past a few tweets im always bombarded by ads also im having major issues trying to change my profile picture and banner
this app no longer has functional consideration for privacy the new block function now allows accounts that are blocked to still view users posts just not interact with them this may potentially allow for stalking harassment andor violence on the part of users would rate a zero if i could
new conditions are abusive and an outright violation of privacy both the ai stealing completely illegal in the ue and the new and improved block function that doesnt block anything i cant believe what el molusko is doing this is just going too far even for him
keeps suggesting me ads and annoying topics i didnt subscribe a lot of spams that they cant be get rid of i dont trust their policy concerning ai generative machines anymore neither its getting worse
elon has make twitter now known as x better but i am still unable to get into my suspended account and the help center is as useful as a punctured condom just adding to my problems i get a string of almost code giving me ring around the rosey with support branches that each tell me to go to another yay
i am someone who prefers writing down my thoughts over expressing them through pictures ive always been a person who maintains a diary throughout x is a good platform for someone like me which allows free flow of thoughts through words
i hate the new update for block feature and not ok with seeing the accounts i was blocked also if i want to see them then i wouldnt block them in the first place get it right if the rating can be i will give this app for sure period
switched phones months ago unable to access account phone account not found i dont remember my username so i try to create a new account but email already in use i emailed for assistance but they did not provide any real assistance
why is it that videos automatically go to another video how do you stop that i truly hate videos going to the next one when i didnt tell it to at least give us the option to stop it
ever since that emerald nepo baby purchased twitteri refuse to call it x it has become a buggy botfilled poorly moderated mess that allows the worst excesses of human depravity to flourish somehow worse than it was before see elon personally reinstating the account of a man that posted csam good job on making the block feature essentially useless now too this should fly well with the app stores that help drive traffic to your app
very problematic video hangs app gets stuck depite having latest phone and proper hi speed broadband hope the x team does something for an otherwise excellent platform
i really hate that stupid blue bubble that constantly appears telling me there are new tweets above it always appears right where im reading and its really distracting why do you shove this annoying stuff in our faces its like you dont want us to use the app or enjoy it at all if you have reasons for having it there that you think are good fine but give those more advanced users who dont need it an option to turn it off please
they bring some irrelevant constant updates that wreck the app when you turn on notifications for certain accounts the posts from those accounts arent kept separate with other notifications that really pisses me off three stars
continually slipping in quality since the musk takeover the algorithms have been changing and i now receive a lot of conservative content in my feed from accounts i dont follow as well as dumber memes and useless videos that seem like they are to musks personal childish taste advertisers have been dropping out and getting replaced by cheap garbage brands its feeling more and more like facebook over there in a bad way
the app is useful for seeing major events when the servers work which they seem to stop every or minutes maybe there is too many useless junk features on it or there are not enough server technicians edit it definitely is too much garbage that no one asked for i have this video auto scroll feature on mobile that you can not turn off no matter where i search i simply seem to not have the option on mobile i would need to go on to desktop in order to stop it
its been being a good app most of the times but i think they need to fix this thing of not being able to scroll all the way down to check what youve liked or retweet in the past
reedit my previous review this app is now by far the most dump app after they converted it to x so many functionalities doesnt work properly like twitter such as video player now it has to load and let you wait to play the video the fyp main page is dump af when leaving the app on some tweet and wan na come back to it later and reopening the app it got ta reload the fyp and lose that tweet just please keep tye fyp as it is when leaving and reentry thx
changed from to star my algorithm was ruined kept getting completely irrelevant political advertisements even after saying i didnt like them also the fact that blocking someone doesnt mean anything anymore youll still see their posts the community has steadily gotten more and more rabid with bots bothering me daily as well really a sad transition from twitter to x
x reiterates the need for exchanging views towards evolution of shaping ideas and to that extent x is doing a great job but many suggestions of its own to the subscriber must be less and should not interfere in their choices
permanently suspended my account saying that i violated x rules or term of service in for which i havent done anything that will violate those i tried submitting an appeal but it wont work update i still keep trying to make an appeal but it just emails the same automated response it keep sending
elon musk bought this website and turned it into a cesspool that uses the guise of free speech to enable terrible people ie predators racists etc to post their opinions without any repercussions additionally the website is filled to the brim with bots using ai generated posts to generate revenue after a change to the blue check system that lets users to get money for posting by subscribing to the apps premium service disgraceful
loads better than it was now the truth isnt considered a crime on the platform especially when it wasnt the same as the government narrative best thing thats happened to a major platform since it all started hope youtube and facebook take a page from elon and starts allowing the truth without kicking people off everyone knows the truth can be painful so anytime someone gets upset is ridiculous its just a matter of time before everyone is banned weve all got truths we dont want heard
why cant i log into my old account that ive had since when it was still twitter when i got a new phone whenever i tried to log in they tell me incorrect password yet its it
it is frequently carshing everytime times when i gone to direct messages after i updated several times but i dont know why it is crashing fix it and respond to my feedback
if i could give zero im giving it a zero every update is literally the worst the recent one with x using our tweets to train ai the changes with block feature so many ads like what even am i gon na be using the app for anyway goodbye deleting it now
why does it keep signing off automatically and then i have to uninstall and reinstall to use this is rd time happening in a month please fix the bug and then rating would improve
x is the only social media platform i use i guess besides messenger to keep in contact with family not on x but its the greatest place ever i practically live there thanks elon
updates are constantly being rolled out to ruin the app removing circles people you block can now see your posts views on posts ai learning from users posts including copyrighted artwork an awful subscription model inteusive ads the list goes on and on and on
fix it edit not by rebranding it another edit this app has so many issues its crazy another edit these guys are stealing money with how much this app doesnt work theres also no customer support at all i wish there was a lower than star rating
x now changing the block function so that people you block can still see your content whats the point of the block function theni dont want people i block to still be able to interact with my content this must a privacy violation of some sort
i cant change font size in this app i tried many times but the option doesnt exist theres problems with notifications also lagging all the time in dms it keeps swapping peoples pfp its a nightmare fix the app
so far as i can tell the st amendment is honored however at times my comments dont seem to be added and if they are its later rather than immediate i dont use fowl language whatsoever and the vast majority of my content is derived from legitimate sources
i love this im speechless about x but i would give five stars if x had download options like instagram now we need to use twitter downloaders for videos x is more than university if one follows good things please add download then x will amazingly perfecto
the android app is pretty broken feed doesnt load media wont play dms crash constantly etc its almost nonfunctional
i have learned a lot been entertained a lot i have shared a lot and i have easily put down this app and went about my day its fast and clean and uplifting encouraging me to be the same the community i have cultivated on this app has been excellent it is what you make it make it about fitness and health and optimism and science and passion and community service best of luck its your world
after a few days and using the like and this post does not interest me buttons my feed is on exactly what i want to see i signed up for x premium to have access to the grok ai chatbot and it is impressive
the for you page on twitterx mostly shows content from accounts im already following it should highlight only new accounts and an option to disable this page or move it to the bottom ribbon would be great additionally browsing the following list is frustrating as it resets to the top after viewing a profile for a few minutes which is particularly annoying for those with followings its been over weeks and all the problems i put in are still there so taking the rating down
the x app allows us to freely communicate by going right around the heavy handed collusion between the telcos and intel by using the free internet and you can tell it really bothers them resist
tweets randomly take ages to load dming people causes the app to crash video quality is horrible no ability to turn off autoplay the timeline randomly scrolls up by itself whenever an ad pops up old bookmarks disappear and every reply has bots thanks elon
it feels like the platform is overrun with misinformation and hate speech ever since the changes the app has been riddled with glitches and the algorithm shows me less of what i care about honestly i hate the new name and logo and i feel like my complaints are falling on deaf ears because customer support is nonexistent it makes me wonder if this app is even good for society anymore
android still does not have the voice tweet feature it has been literally years and clearly yall have no intention to give android users the same features iphone users get there are constant bugs i cant view all my own tweets on my profile many just dont show up for no discernable reason i often get the option to delete other peoples photo posts after maximizing the photo obvi doesnt work but why does that come up just weird bugs that make no sense
this app used to work okay before but now it is barely usable because of the insane amount of advertisements that keep showing up even if you had repeatedly said you are not interested the search engine doesnt even work anymore because when you search with a keyword it will show you things not even mentioning the keyword much less related to the keyword there is no point in adding new features while comepletely destroying what made twitter good in the first place
obnoxious that every time im looking at a post and the whole page updates and scrolls up and the post dissappears what is the point of translate post if it never works the ads are also repeat multiple times and dont even work videos keep scrolling to the next video and no longer loop keep pausing itself or just dont play at all due to playback error broken app
this app no longer works at least percent of the time or more the content will not load or refresh when this happens sometimes it takes upwards of hours before it work again its become so frequent that i have quit using x this app and x is useless now refreshing clearingdeleting cache and data uninstalling and reinstalling etc none of it has helped resolve the issue not even temporarily
no option to turn off automatically playing new video after finishing current one no option to turn off recommended notifications no option to turn off spaces appearing on top of screen hogging space on my screen no sort feature for comments so all you see are bots promoting under posts with blue checks pro tip invest the time to mute or block them all it does help there are key features missing to make this app actually feel good or fun to use
the new auto scrolling for videos is completely broken crashes the app and recently triggered a migraine by suddenly scrolling to a video with flashing lights there is no option to turn it off some people say theres a little cog in the bottom left when you open a video but i and many others so not have it anywhere
since takeover by the x brand it has gone downhill verified is now a monetised feature for the platform moderation is partisan and minimal disturbing destructive content is boosted
very informative easy to navigate and set up full of free speech for adults who can process information correctlyonly no kidding everyone is welcome thats the point its awesome
its been run into a shambolic state the for you page is now just full of random tripe a singular like can influence your feed to be full of anything from politics to porn profile pictures are unviewable as they all come up blurry the not interested in this tweet button only brings more of the same things unmutable ad pages has to be the lowest of the low giving shite like temu or dropshippers ads that cant be muted is so so so bad
it doesnt have an acceptable block feature its incredibly dangerous not to have a block feature that actually blocks a person
since i cant go any lower than one star this is all i can do for this app been on twitter x for years and this is the worst its been i constantly have trouble with the app loading and freezing i am unable to refresh my messages and my feed and the spaces either freeze up or you cant hear the audio at all also when you block something you can still see it elsewhere
some things are certainly better than the old app spam bots are far fewer in number than they used to be when sending a post looking for interaction from the op being the first to reply is helpful but thats difficult now as theres an intentional delay feature active i cant get rid of it says sending post and delays about ten seconds i can chase the post down and tell it to send now and it will but that takes three or four seconds how do i shut this problem feature off thank you
so focused on looking nice that a lot of its functions are just gone elon does not care about actually fixing the app notifications are permanently gone when uploading photos always met with failed to send post to top it off it always crashes after a certain amount of time find something better to use genuinely do not get this app edit elon made likes private now its even easier for weirdos and creeps to hide this app sucks the five star ratings are lies
its really cool that this app spontaneously stops working despite me using it not even minutes prior and then remains completely broken anywhere between minutes and hours at a time i have never dealt with as many bots on this platform during the first years i used it than i have within the last year truly incredible work
slowly circling the drain app is ridiculously buggy pages randomly refresh for no discernable reason and loses everything you were looking at or doing videos autoadvance to next and nonrelated videos with no way to disable content is heavily biased towards magabros toxic posts and ads and your feed will be filled with it even if you dont follow overrun with of and poorn content clicking hide or not interested only increases the frequency of which youll see the unwanted content
always had a great experience on twitterx made friends for life and thats what it should be about its what makes the world go round
great apart from the full screen ads that are awkward to scroll past
content from non verified people can be entertaining but twitter is constantly making the site itself awful by adding more ads adding features no one asked for and promoting some biased accounts especially the ones who pay no i dont want the next video to auto play after watching a second clip so close to tapping out
dear x support team i am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding the unjust suspension of my premium monetized account pioneerjoshua this sudden and unexpected action has caused significant emotional distress and financial hardship despite multiple appeals i have consistently received automated responses that do not address the specific issues or provide a clear resolution this lack of personalized attention and effective communication has only exacerbated
this app has been unusable for the better of the past few months ive had to resort to using the mobile website because it does not refresh my feed and even then the website is still underperforming it seems like it gets worse before it gets better with every update its been an absolute mess since the change in ownership nonstop ads that are loaded with ai bots are taking over support system is nonexist its a disaster
was alright until the app started glitching out my home screen the second i came off of the app also the ads are a lot to deal with and are kind of annoying at times especially since theyre everywhere even when you press the comments of a post basically too many glitches and double the ads
the app is a constantly buggy wont load pictures banned in my country yet still the best place on the internet and worth dealing with the technical difficulties
putting aside the million questionable decisions made on the platform the app itself is also just garbage videos fail to play inconsistent ui elements ex some videos have download option some dont and just an overall horrendous app to navigate and use its actually impressive how elon somehow managed to make it this bad insane
i use several social media apps including facebook x when i check the facebook app i always receive the latest updates such as minutes seconds however when i check the x app i mostly do not get the latest updates sometimes i only see news from several hours ago does x management know about this problem and what are the solutions
awesome app however i receive messages that ive been logged out at times and i have to take an arkose challenge kindly look into this issue
this application does not show me that someone sent me a message even though i turned on notifications and accepted messages from everyone and did not filter the lowest quality messages i have lost many customers because of this glitch alerts of messages from my new customers who send me messages before following me do not appear even though my account is blue but i hope that there will be an immediate alert a popup message even if i am outside the program the same as facebook messenger
x used to be an amazing app but these days it keeps logging me out its soo annoying because all my already prepared saved drafts would be gone when i login again why do i have to suffer the loss of what took me almost the whole day to write just because the app wants me to reenter my account details can this be fixed already because its ruining everything
i feel like this app just work less and less multiple times thought the day it just hangs and doesnt refresh every other app on my phone loads fine so its not internet clearing cache and force stopping sometimes works like in a dozen times pretty pathetic showing from one of the biggest social media site on the planet
this app is working so poorly that my phone keeps telling me it has a bug and begging me to put it in deep sleep mode it has crashed repeatedly photos and videos often dont load even when i am getting a strong wifi signal its becoming very frustrating to use
newest update has this stupid feature that auto advances your videos ios can disable this android cant until i can you get star not recommended went out and found an old version of the app uninstalled this one installed the old one back to normal will not update or change from till auto advance is gone
the app likes to refresh your feed whenever you open it which on paper sounds like a good idea im sure however in my experience your feed will have a cool picture or an interesting post you want to read and then poof its gone forever unless you get lucky and find it again after over a minute of scrolling this happens every time i open the app and often itll do it twice so you get the experience of seeing something you like and then having it yeeted twice
im new to it only about a month and i love the variety and interesting stories and connecting with the people but what i find very annoying and frustrating is how complicated unexplanatory the wholeapp all itsscreensare for doing anything everything throughout theapp with just very tiny indecipherable little icons that you just have totry get whateveritis you wantdo orsee onit
this app has become so ad infested you cant even scroll tweets without seeing ads in return for the next one theyre not even the ad accounts that you can block or mute but the ads that bring you to the playapp store even after you say you dont want those ads anymore they still put it in your face as if it gives it to you more the more you say you dont want it is it that hard to remove the ads that i chose not to see anymore make the ads blockable it ruins the experience in the app
app is okay but videos havent been working for me lately and the ads are getting ridiculous ive seen nine in a row once other than getting rid of ads i have no reason to get a subscription and i dont want to pay just to get rid of ads
then i cancelled the subscription and made payment on july but till date my account has not been verified inspite daily reminder on x my account was verified on august when i cancelled my subscription now again my account has been de verified and now when again i want it to verify it ask the mobile no but when i enter the mobile no it ask to send text message to a uk no which not possible please make it easy to enter mobile
i love x and what it offers from an information perspective however the app constantly daily will stay stuck loading forever and wont load content even if my wifi has full connectivity just wind up giving up sometimes after i try force stopping and waiting a couple of minutes i really hope this gets fixed soon because i really enjoy x and may have to use the web version only
the fact that the about this app states nothing but that it was formerly twitter speaks volumes about what it has become today after new updates we are issued new functions that only serve to inconvenience users backtoback advertisements after every few posts hidden likes barelyfunctioning search functions this app has been declining at a steady rate every update is barely if at all useful and minimally improves the qol at best and drastically deproving standards at worst
everything on this app has gotten progressively worse as of recent buggy mess with awful problems in moderation and toxicity worst of all theyre trying to change the tos to limit what we can view unless we pay this defeats the purpose of social media its supposed to be an endless world at your fingertips limit that and your platform begins to worsen the social part is supposed to be a part of the package
it no longer loads new posts posts cant be viewed in a large window when clicked on keeps on kicking out of the account and logging itself into a suspended account its just a mess cant view any messages notifications basically its bottomed out
wasnt great before the switch to x now worse than ever the block feature is officially now functionally useless for half the reason people use it the comments are overrun with bots and blue checks copying other peoples tweets to farm engagement and get money for it and normal descriptive words are causing tweets to be censored if youre not stuck on here already get out while you can
the most annoying app you can ever download is x logs you out of your account for no reason they disable your account for no reason and when you contact them via email they do not reply you go two days without using the app when you return you have to go through robot check or email verification like what the hell the painful part is that the infos i need can only be found on x but its annoyingly and unnecessarily secured you guys should work on that
its still twitter to me despite the broken video player pauses randomly and autoplay doesnt always stop the last video from playing so you get great audio overlap sometimes it gets so bad you got ta shut the app down and restart
it just stop working randomly even though i have a good network connection it just refuses to load this app has not been working well since its rebranding also ive getting very stange tweets in my for you page even though ive clicked not interested for those whats the use of collecting my data if you are not going to give me a good for you page
if you dont pay you need to be able to disassociate the ads randome reload when open still happening and after a few minutes the videos stop working showing a pplayback error restart works but you lost your progress or the video you want to look only top posts in your you section and if you see one political post or trend that will hunt you all the month in your feed
rarely use this app but can be useful when i need it one day my i found out that my account has been suspended due to spamming scams yes it was hacked and emailed support to recover my account i got an email back saying that my account has been unrestricted but it was still restricted after that tried contacting them again multiple times with response since
app is stable in every area except for spaces improved feed with more a realtime feel in the following tab however ive noticed spaces uses a lot of phone battery also navigation in other apps can cause x to crash while spaces are actively being listened to in the background
this app is broken it keeps refreshing on itself when im scrolling through an account or even on the timeline sometimes please fix this this is very annoying edit this is getting even more ridiculous now i cant even retweet a tweet without the app being refreshed on itself when is twitter gon na fix this
when will we be able to upgrade from premium to premium plus for android users this is getting pretty annoying and ridiculous at this point update i finally had to let the subscription expire then buy via a pc overall i like x for free speech and what elon is doing with grok worth the money
after video plays it automatically scrolls to the next and i cant fing stand it anymore at least give me the option to stop it like on ios x app also once a day the app doesnt load i have to close and reopen times to get it to function normally
very buggy in recent months issues with timeline not refreshing failing to load videos bell tab not showing any notifications and instead saying join the conversation yet the verified notifications tab works unrelated but the increase in bot activity in the replies of even lightly popular posts is insane verified users often bots are thrown to the top and drown out normal users replies half these are bots promoting their adult accountsvarious other endeavors
i dont like the new name also the app just straight up stops working when youre charging your phone im not even joking also i got ads in a row once edit ive just gotten ads in a row edit new record
i dont understand whats the issue with x after every few days they block my account again do verificationsotpssolve puzzles etc and now they have suspended my account without any reason i have followed the support team appeal instructions to unsuspend my account but no results what i do they dont have any helpline email system either am exhausted from x my account is three years old my all data is there and they suspended it i dont understand whats the issue with them
this app has serious issues notifications dont display the time anymore replying on notifications really doesnt work when i go to the regular x app i find at least percent if my tweets havent gone through i pay for my blue chip someone needs to address these issues
the constant request to update the app started to piss me off how many times do i have to update the freaking app i just update the app yesterday and the day before twitter used to be good it was fun easy to navigate it doesnt logged me out randomly now x its just like one of the trashy social media app out there do better
only problem i have with the app is i am only able to access it through clicking on notifications when i try to use the app through the icon on my phone i have to sign in every time and get an error and kicked out of the app
its pretty reliable overall it has pretty decent content i just wish musk would focus more on tesla and his other efforts i guess my options on him shouldnt affect my rating on this necessarily im sure for many it does free speech is important but you can not force people to listen to the speechesspeeking of others with that said i appreciate the ability to filter and customize my feed i hope some day elon and all his children will find understanding with each other
why oh why did they change it so that videos auto jump to the next video it is so dumb because of how x twitter works videos are often half over by the time you actually scroll to them so you click on the video and wait for it to start over but now it just jumps to a new video from random accounts you dont follow this is what happens when you fire all of your talented developers and only keep the cheap ones year that x employees elon thinks cheap and that is why you he keeps you
app doesnt load fresh content when the phone is charging it also takes a long time to open posts and replies auto playing random videos without notice is annoying after extended usage they app doesnt load fresh content images dont open until you shut it down and open again lots of playback errors on videos
multiple operating issues when selecting a video it will auto roll into an ad and lock the video player also if you are charging your device the app will stop updating data and no new posts will load
day by day the technical issues in x is underwhelming too much trouble its getting blank often videos getting troubled to played needed like option to be enable need to rectify everything than overdo
this thing is super glitchy lately currently if youre watching a video and flip up to the next the audio from the previous video still plays over the next video so i close out the videos and it still plays nothing open just random audio playing i have to completely close the app to get it to stop
the app keeps deactivating my account every time i try to share a tweet with multiple accounts and i then have to do an arkose test to reactivate my account right on cue my account was deactivated today after i tried to share a tweet with multiple accounts but this time the arkose test didnt show up i only had a blank screen now it says i have failed the arkose test too many times and that i should try again later it has been several hours and i still cant get in rubbish
updated as of the recent update the video player constantly comes back with a playback error of the time videos break and i have to stop the app processes and refresh just to have maybe two videos work the ads that now flood my timeline are all malware links this app is just extremely slow and constantly breaks out of nowhere there are no fixes being made it seems like something new breaks with every update my app also stops working completely when i charge my phone
a bad thing compared to previous versions is that the feed refreshes automatically when you restart the app previously the feed used to refresh but you still used to be on the same post and it was upto you to press the home button and see the updated posts i prefer that version over the latest where the newer posts appear automatically
the current version of the app sucks doesnt load even after taking long time im stuck on the same tweet i viewed the night before its been loading for the last hour ive exited the app and restarted the phone and it is still not loading i think this is a way to encourage people to get the paid version
i have extremely fast internet service yet a lot of nontext content takes forever to load or refuses to load at all if you post a video please share the youtube link so this way i dont have to wait for thr video to not play i can just instantly start watching the video on youtube there is so much content that i have had to skip over sometimes postafterpost due to how unreliable the service actually is i dont have to wait on any other app
please consider removing the autoscroll for videos twitter x is the only platform that still allows some agency for users when it comes to content viewing and its why i still stayed it makes the experience frustrating because the point of using this app is to see tweetsposts and not doomscrolling for reels the recent update increasing the bottom function buttons to is also frustrating and makes the app unnecessarily complicated when most users only use of the functions daily
one star is actually stars the app is a complete mess direct messages barely work the app itself becomes unresponsive and broken when you charge your phone and bottom tablbs feel almost intrusive and unnecessary i now have to resort to using the web app because of how terrible it became get your act together x corp if you still have any
made an account barley did anything on it and it got suspended for no reason so i appealed i got it unsuspended then it got suspended again and now they wont unsuspend it and wont say why its even suspended so if there is some random reason i could resolve it very disappointing now ive been randomly logged out twice today and its becoming a real pain in the butt to get logged back in its a shame i do enjoy that platform but these issues are very unpleasant its dont it again
since new update and new annoying ads after every posts its gotten so bad cant even swipe down because its feel like i am using phone from its so slow
the app is fun and informative information on the news feed is current and orientated futuristically past stories however can be viewed in users time lines
i am facing the problem from last days since then i have uninstalled and install the app again for more than times after installing the app x is running smoothly for the next minute and then it stop working and while refreshing the page new tweet is not getting reloaded i am alsonot able to see any notification looks like my internet is not working homepage profile page settings or any other page is not getting open
there has to be more options to set up your profile privacy according to your preferences especially if you locked up your profile you can not choose exceptions individuals only designated chosen tweets to display notifications frequency and numbers in a day everything else is just fine thank you
twitter is a good app but there is problem in creating account on twitter please fix it there is written there after loading that something is not right try your request again later i have to do an important work but its continuously occuring please try to fix it as soon as possible i have tried to update it and also cleared data but that note is still occuring so please try to fix it
the people you block can still see your posts yes they cant interact with it but they can screenshot and harass you this is not a proper block feature and it violated play stores policy
it helps me interact and waste time when i need time to move quickly unfortunately when scrolling through accounts it will randomly jump back to the top which kills motivation to look at others content also been running into an issue with the whole time line not loading properly will update reading whenif fixed
so far im very satisfied with the app my only concern is with the automatic refresh every time im scrolling it is really annoying and i dont know how to disable it
the video in ad autoplaying even while i turn off the autoplay on both wifi and mobile internet is annoying you had to turn down your volume to zero everytime you open this elondoomed app and choosing i dont like this ad option wont work i wont pay for premium on social media but i wont tolerate being bombarded with crypto ads that i cant even turn away from ill stop myself from scrolling the timeline until this get fixed
year ago this app started to crash i can only see up to first posts on the feed even after uninstalling and reinstalling i cant see anything its so frustrating the web version is like that too at first i thought its because of my wifi however the issue is not solved after switching network can someone pls help me
november the new block function encourages harrassment and prevents healthy discourse and the hidden likes update can be very dangerous september twitter was my favorite app for years but elon musks useless additions have ruined it
doesnt show posts if app is not updated lags a lot while charging the phone posts dont appear quickly with g connectivity
it could have been more than stars but lately the app keeps logging users out and finally when i tried logging in i got suspended please do me a favor and delete my record from your database if you will not lift the suspension thanx
it always doesnt work well even when my data connection is okay it still doesnt give me what i search for all it says is oops something has went wrong but dont worry it is not your problem so annoying
free speech is great but porn where i dont want it is annoying at the first level a lot of the influencers are tired of porn bots sending them stuff
video streaming without constant ad interruptions much freer speech independent news aggregation whats not to like except ideas that youve been sheltered from hate speech is speech that you hate
whats wrong with x whenever i try to log into my account on another device they tell me that my account couldnt be found this has been happening for years and everytime im required to create another account
i just joined x but on the very first day my account got suspended not only with my phone but with other phones i had its really awful the management of this app is probably dead
everything has gone downhill since twitter died and x replaced it the ads are intrusive and they are using artists work for ai
what once was a great platform has now become a cesspool of disinformation misinformation racism misogyny and white supremacy i recommend blue sky or threads as much better alternatives
i guess the platform is only enjoyable for subscribed users if youre not subscribed you get shadowbanned your posts and comments dont get much views plus you get logged out like due to an error twice a week and have to complete a captcha because x servers think you are a bot pathetic
everythings great but that part whereby you cant see everyone youre following on the list it only shows less
app is just closing anytime i click to watch video or try to scroll down its becoming unbearable to know what is trending
this app so unoptimized sometimes it crash when i play video and this app always crash after i send someone text wf fix it
why does the whole page have to refresh every time you go back after watching a video its pretty much frustrating when you finish watching a video go back to the previous page and the whole page gets refreshed automatically when you are watching the content below the video please fix this asap
why has my x app suddenly started auto logging me out then not allowing me to log back in again absolutely hopeless im so close to deactivating my account again
constantly receiving playback error on videosthe only way to get videos to load is to close out the app and clear cachebut when you do thatthe page refreshes and the video you were trying to watch is gonethe ads are utterly insane every posts i have to scroll past multiple ads i once had ads in a row pop up and to top it off the algorithm has been faulty i have been receiving posts on my feed of things i have no interest in i hit no interest and still receive posts about them
so i didnt know why everyone keeps asking if i am on twitter so i just made an account i dont know if its just me but after making my account i was confronted nudity and rudeoffensive topics all over my newsfeed i reported the nudity only to have twitter redefine that what they seem acceptable im sorry but as a girl nudity is nudity whether explicit or implicit and i dont understand why parents are even allowing kids on this as i honestly dont care for this content
app works fine had issue upgrading from premium basic to premium ended up canceling my subscription to try to resubscribe with upgrade didnt work right away tried again a couple of days later and was finally able to get the screen on x that lets you upgrade not sure if they fixed the upgrade process or if you just need to unsubscribe wait then resubscribe later
i love x because it has a focus on disseminating information i wish i knew this earlier if you want to be updated choose x for timely info choose x
an appallingly bad app that seems to get progressivly worse over time posts often dont load properly and videos regularly have playback issues for you is full of irrelevant trash often ai generated where as the following tab never seems to update at all
worst appit suspends account without any previous reasons so disappointed i have appealed many times but didnt unsuspend my account i didnt done anything against twitter policy it is so frustrating that you didnt do any wrong thing and your account suspended worst experience ever
cant turn captions off even when my device volume is up what is the point of the captions when i rarely watch videos in english on this app anyways because the language is english microsoft butchers the non english language if youre going to put this feature at least give people an option to turn it off completely edited to add this app keeps getting worse and worse ever since e guy took over
its great to have more free speech and new functions keep being added the spaces are interesting lots of memes the subscriber benefits are great now you can post long videos write articles use their ai grok for art and answers to most questions interest based community groups fun
fix your app you have the most nasty ads ever i say i dont like this ad your app has a fit and doesnt remove it why i dont want to see porn update theres naked jailbait girl ads please i dont want to see porn if i block porn bots what makes you think i wan na see porn ads ban plamfy ads they are disgusting
what i like most is that the content is real news x keeps me better informed than the mainstream news stations i quit watching news stations in and only recently joined x after elon musk revamped the whole system im a recent participant so im not sure how to answer the optional questions
dear x team i have contacted u so many times its been months i facing this issue like i cant able to join spaces calls but i can post etc it always shows to restore suspended account its but when i submit appeal it says your account is not suspended kindly please fix this issues i m using this acc for atleast years
its getting better more freedom to say what you feel you need to have thick skin using it or just interact with sports not politics if you are soft remember if you click multiple political account the algorithm is going give you mostly politics most people who complain just hate the owner and theyre soft the interface is easy to understand nothing complicated
i am just learning how to use the appi am elderly soul trying to learn on my ownwas kick off for a post that i thought was law or fact for treason i dont understand what was wrongi see a lot worse video and post but i guess its a learning curve
this app not only can approach the world but also it is a feature to keep you on waiting for all day to open it super slowmotion loading feature is bugging me while using your app im waiting for the solution kindly solve this problem asap thank you regards
glitches and stops working for two hours a day media loads slowly even on wifi doesnt work when phone is charging
everything was good until last update it is automatically getting logged out without my permission and now it is not logging in bad experience
the page doesnt load it happens very hours and you have to wait for minutes or so everytime please fix this app
app is irrelevant now that linking no longer works too many artists have left the platform sluggish performance compared to twitter days ads are embedded in more confusing ways now
app works pretty well seems to remove tweets in my feed update refreshes screen after scrolling a few times updater app doesnt refresh screen after scrolling better
cant login anymore i put in my credentials and then it loops me back to the login screen and i was logged in before too edit still cant login
not that good of an app started crashing frequently when it was changed to x and now the artists are gone becuase elon wants to exploit them if u want art use blxby
grok ui sometimes bugs out where the top navigation section with history and new question button disappear requiring a restart of the app
lots of propaganda and misinformation from all political sides its also a breeding ground for conspiracy theorists however it remains a platform which promotes discussion often toxic but its better than no discussion and thus encourages a civilized resolution to societal issues and the spread of important information
app is slow sometimes doesnt load new posts even if it loads new posts it doesnt load images and videos
the rampant hate speech update to blocked accounts and now free reign for ai training is making me leave hope this app makes elon go bankrupt forever forever calling this garbage app twitter as long as it is run by twits like this
still same buggy bugs locking up not loading vids dont play comments dont load even after several updates since last notes keep experiencing issues lock ups not loading very buggy
app is trash cant even open links without it bugging out elon ruined app cant even get things in chronological order
whats with this whole username thing my phone got reset and now when i try to sign in it says username why cant it just be email or password or phone number cant use your app until you fix this
barely works half the time and the site is set up to push extremist right wing propaganda onto your timeline without ever interacting with content like that the block feature being defanged and all your posts being fed into ai sealed the deal of closing out my accounts
these app doesnt do well anymore sometimes video play without sound or sound continuelys play without stop and i have to crash to stop the app
the app was nice but it cant even update on my phone cant show any replies to posts cant retrieve data whats wrong with the app please fix up x
constantly glitching dms randomly close out quotes dont show up too many dumb ads too many bots too much allowed racism every update simply makes it worse that man has ruined this app
not good everytime i typed a message it always turned black and then back to menuuuuu so frustratingggg
works well seems like sometimes my followed accounts dont show up like they should get random people constantly popping up on my feed
great functionality including a lot of offline caching could use better search but its getting better
this app hangs a lot my phone is very recent with all the required hardware with android version still out of apps in my phone only x hangs
honestly since the last few days and thr latest update the app just keeps crashing you americans cant write a proper app for android
ive had a problem everytime i sign in to the app yet the system kick me out every single time after the update what a mess
incredibly laggy spontaneously jumps to top of timeline limit on scrolling is ridiculous exponentially worse since ellens takeover
wont let me log in keeps saying cant log intry again later every time i try to log in i try to log in later and it still says that i hope you can fix this bug i will leave this review until you can fix this error hope you fix this bug soon
its a terrible app whos policies depend on the emotional state of its owner that day ive never seen an account you cant even delete only deactivate
i know one thing i have heard that everyone is starting to migrate to this app the big reason why ill never tell no its because they found out its very easy to monatise and make money with it yes you will make money but you have to follow the details in the direction
i used to be able to delete suggestions in the trending area of the search bar and now i cant there are so many political suggestions that i dont want to see at all but i dont have the option to say that i dont want to see them
a joke i paid for premium and i still cant access basic features like changing my profile picture it takes a special kind of talent to ruin a website this hard
ive tried many apps but x is truly one of the best its star rating is a testament to its quality functionality and overall excellence from its intuitive interface to its robust features x has consistently impressed me the developers have clearly prioritized user experience and it shows whether youre a seasoned user or new to the app x is definitely worth checking out keep up the fantastic work developers youve earned a loyal fan in me
this refresh issue makes the app completely worthless it can go hours without loading anything and it forces the app if you try to use the website as well uninstalling until there is an actual fix for this issue
this app is completely cooked it refuses to load my feed or posts about of the time making it completely unusable clearing cache and force closing it does not help ffs do something
there are things i like there are things i dont like there are also more unstability to this app such as unpredictable refreshing of main page and sometimes the app will lose connection to the server entirely needing to be killed and relaunched so overall this app is no longer the twitter experience i once liked
why is there no persistent navigation bar at the bottom as soon as i navigate away from the home screen all the quick commands at the bottom disappear so if i want to get back to the home screen i have to hit the back button times or completely close the app and open it fresh what is that the home button is only accessible while im actually on the home page itself but as soon as i navigate away from the home page it disappears make it make sense
the auto scroll when a video is done is annoying please add a way to turn that off this app didnt use to auto scroll and it was better that way
update autoscroll is the worst feature yet who designed this nobody wants it and i cant turn it off in android the support and development for this app are so bad they develop features nobody asks for yet have to pay to access and then the app bugs sit untouched i cant reload my time line half the time im in the app it never refreshes posts just recycles the same ones just a terrible software platform i used to use a rd party app but that no longer is an option
used to be a good app to waist time on but now i cant even watch a video without it auto scrolling to something entirely unrelated ive had both violence and sex related videos play after watching a simple art or animation video almost unusable and incredibly frustrating when theres no way to turn this off
the app now breaks one of apples and googles rules and wont allow you to actually block people therefore letting people you have blocked see your profile best to move to another app or avoid twitter as much as possible unless they give you your privacy back
the block feature is completely useless whats the point of blocking someone if they can still view my account elon has ruined this app
absolutely horrible in the last few months the app will simply stop working times a day for up to an hour not sure what your doing but just stop leave the app as it is its incredibly frustrating
the fact that people i have blocked because i do not want to interact with them are once again showing in my timeline is frustrating
its very worst app i have ever seen what the useless app in terms to playing videos it get stucks every time every minutes i am fed up with these apps i always keep this app updated but this app doesnt work welleven the photo is not visible well i have no problem with the content that i seeso the app needs more work to be stable
lags so much or doesnt load even when it does load its just the same content over and over again elon ruined this app
whenever i click on comment icon it force me to reply and not showing comments what kind of app is this facebook is lot better than this u failed as developer u guys are joke not less than this
its one of the best platforms out there if you support freedom of speech as long as you dont break any lawsyour opinions are allowed you will see and hear things on x that you see nowhere else its a valuable resource and it deserves your support really interesting and informative stuff
was able to fix the issues below by changing my pw but now the new update no idea how auto update was suddenly selected automatically skips to the next video and its horrible change it back elon my drafts arent saving anymore app doesnt work when my phone is charging i have zero issues with any other apps while charging elon fix your d app
warning the recent change to the blocking feature allowing people you have blocked to still view your posts violates data and privacy policies meaning that the apple and play stores will not be able to platform this app once the feature comes into effect this new change allows stalkers to continue to harass victims
control over what i see on my timeline had been degrading as time goes on ads are no longer actual tweets they are redirects to other sites videos auto scroll with no way to disable that feature which conveniently the next video is always an ad i see less stuff relevant to me and more stuff relevant to trends a have no interest in this is no longer social media its just ad space unless you pay for premium which you still see ads anyways so whats the point
everything is paid here which is not a good move to engage users we talk about free internet services a few times ago net neutrality is gone now every app has its own paid content changing its original features its original name is not ok
the app is in very poor condition i cant even change my password as nothing would load when i try to change my password even the help center of this app is not working im having worst ever experience with this useless app
shows me the same ad again and again for the crappiest mobile game ive disliked the ad so many damn times
its great to use i like how it supports my right to free speech and that i am able to voice my opinion without my account being permanently terminated because i violated a dumb censorship rule however that may change if they go against my right to free speech phone and email should both be obligated for signing up not one or the other overall its a great app
worst app have good internet connection but it always showing loading take lot of time to show feeds even many it didnt do loading and cant do refresh my feed
this month when i was using the updated android application my account was suspended twice and the interesting thing is that when i deleted the application from my phone i could no longer find it in the list of android applications in google play
speed has improved spam has reduced i am spending noticeably more time on the app the content i see is more fun and relevant to me compared to before all in all seems to be on a better path ahead
after a while from twitter coming back to x has been such an underwhelming experience the application id full of bugs constantly struggle to smoothly render play video content this is shocking the app has chosen to be invested toouvh into politics and social ideologies caring very little about building an app that actually works
this app not show anything and i try open it at browser run completly fine and normal but when i open the app again the app fail retrive someting like that
it became even worse than before whenever i enter twitter my account gets logged out and never works but then when i close the app and open it again it works this is getting annoying keep me logged in all the time please
stuff doesnt load anymore it barely works images dont load neither do peoples pages bookmarks my own profile or either of these timelines performance has gone down the drain the app is near useless if you plan to keep using this site youll probably be stuck to a browser on your computer assuming that works
twitter has been going downhill since the end of i am more frustrated with it than ive ever been autorefreshing the home page unbanning accounts that were banned for a good reason slowing down the home page to the point that images take a full seconds to load and now videos automatically scroll to the next one when its finished instead of replaying twitter is becoming genuinely unusable
there has been an update in the newer versions having more relevant trending topics however i cant remove some irrelevant topics from my trending list this is something that should be brought back
timeline frequently gets stuck and will not refresh pictures and videos will not load you can not reply or like anything or check your dms its not a connection issue every other app is working perfectly force closephone reset does not fix the issue it persists for hours sometimes days until it finally refreshes find another app for trending news joined more than a decade ago but the app became unusable trash quickly under the new ownership its valuation reflects this
ever since elon took over the android app does not load anything no timeline no messages no point ive been using twitter for years and this only started happening when it became x cleared cache no change s ultra works fine on the web version it is embarrassing how blatant the regression of functionality has become at x
dumbest app ever i used to use it when it was twitter and ever since it became x i been seeing grown men fight women or people getting shot over and over and im so tired of it fix this god damn app o dont want to open this app and the first thing i see is people dying
this app keeps getting worse and worse by the second its always glitching and when youre finally able to log in youre bombarded with spam accounts sending you private messages or requesting to follow you i dont remember it ever having these many spam accounts on the platform theres no point in using it
i got suspended for absolutely no reason and now the stupid app wont let me file an appeal its been a few days now and i cant create an account or submit an appeal i suggest deleting this retared app and save yourself the trouble
next video autoplay is so annoying redirect to not related content from the tweet i was reading also too much trump in news so not independent
its very informative will real news as to what is really going on in the world im from the uk and british news is lies
ads increased exponentially and i get constant playback error on most videos i can bookmark and come back to the video later with better luck proof the issue is not a personal setting or hardware on my side but disruptive amazing how when the rest of user experience goes to hell ads always work
its a lot better what it was before i had twit face i mean twitter i tried it didnt like it thank you elon keep up the great work
getting notification alerts from people that i have never interacted with or followed that are spreading false information i specifically have my setting to filter out low quality notifications yet continually still receive them i should not be getting alerts on false terrorists attacks or false reports on the president having a medical emergency
post being tagged as ad ive cleared cache uninstalled then reinstalled and some posts on timeline come up as an ad post but they are just normal accounts will leave app uninstalled until glitch or whatever it is is gone and my timeline returns back to normal
years later update this app has gone downhill largely due to its owner the site is toxic the ads are terrible i dont trust my data with the owner and so many people have fled the app is less enjoyable and informative i have uninstalled x twitter maybe someday if elon sells it or it goes public with elon leaving the company i will consider reinstalling it
app progressively runs worse and worse with no available solution videos have constant playback errors posts dont load the like or save functions sometimes just decide not to work its horrendous i cant wait until this company goes bankrupt
truly redefined social media for me the platforms seamless integration of news entertainment and personal connections makes it a onestopshop for staying informed and engaged the ability to customize my feed ensures i see content that matters most to me new features like spaces and enhanced direct messaging have made the experience even more interactive and enjoyable x is where realtime conversation happens and its been exciting to witness its evolution highly recommended
recently this app has been trying to censor me it wont let me like other peoples posts and when i mention this on the app my post gets deleted i thought this was supposed to be a free speech app
x formerly twitter is still a dynamic platform for realtime news and diverse opinions its short format encourages concise expression and the integration of various media types keeps the experience engaging the rebranding to x has brought a sleek new look and promises innovative features however some users may find the transition jarring and certain functionalities still need refinement overall x retains twitters core strengths while aiming for broader appeal its a platform worth
its pretty good however its next to impossible to change your id picture on your page its ridiculous besides that it okay
worst experience ever i paid for a subscription and now im getting logged out every time i try to like or reply to a post what kind of scam is this im literally paying for this service and cant even interact with the content fix your broken app or give me my money back this is unacceptable do better
there are frequent issues with the app freezing at random times for random durations
elon musk keeps blinking my x out also a lot of propaganda is spewed by him especially now before elections right now my app goes to other apps opens them then it blinks out resets to sine place else only on this app does any of this happen privacy would mean no hackers or bots x has both unless you pay you cant upload videos most of them are tick tock anyway
i am giving it this low because of the awful decisions elon made and changes to the app it isnt user friendly anymore and the aesthetic and beauty and uniqueness of the app is gone now it looks like a lifeless app that is so dull when it comes to creativity
you can voice your opinions follow people worldwide and create friendships with anyone plus have private conversations in chat messages as well
ads auto play even in data saver mode now and the audio kicks in even if you have it muted
i ll give it to starthe worst app compare to instagram facebooki have created x account days back now it shows your account has been suspendedif i do subscription then only it allowed to me use this appfor subscription u have to pay moneywhy should i pay for it when i use instagram facebook free dont use this app
i would have rated if x support was genuine x is great in everything else but they dont offer user support when most required imagine someone changed our email without our knowledge yet according to the usage language the hacker os a arabic we dont know and have never interracted with them but x could not help us we reported and they never respond
dms bugs every time i try to talk to someone it doesnt let me type at all making the app freeze this has been happening for a few months now fix it
much better than ever x is the only platform you really can see whats going on throughout the world in real time it offers real insights into the details of events people sports movies animals outdoors you name it first app i put on my new phone
many people say thing i dont like disagree with and are outright hateful thats free speech theres mute block and report that are there for those reasons so you dont have to read it the algorithm will give you what you involve yourself with so its time for me to look up non political posts concentrate on peace joy and health we have the power to change our experiences with x
well i normally dont have any issue with this app but it keeps logging me out and now when i go to log back in and just says error i have updated the app i have tried to restart my phone and nothing
its the only social media platform where you can find real stories about the real deal information msm wont report doing ones own research and common sense are essential to decipher the occasional bait story or fake story but no different than anything else real free speech real stories real life if i could work for them i would
so many bugs and promoted ads builtin translator and muting still doesnt work properly unrelated content keep popping up on my tl even after i follow specific accounts and unfortunately has been a cesspool of unnecessary pornography the amount of indian bots engagement farming is insane reevaluate your policies and take control of this platform
twitterx are considerably limiting the functionality of the block button making it not a real block anymore they are also adding a k fee if you view over mill tweets in a day this includes the spam and horrific content that will be flooding the for you pages so someone could easily get screwed because of the apps own issues
i have joined this x app on im unable to say in this moment without confirming this app i am not having any more to say regarding x without taking the further knowledge im not able today to say anything
this app got so buggy ever since the takeover by elon musk app keeps crashing followers take forever to recover after deactivating searching tweets of people by name never works anymore quotes dont load when trying to check what people in the quotes are saying about a certain post overall very buggy
for some reason the app keeps on loading when my internet connection is stable and fast autoscroll on videos is also annoying
cool app but i really hate that it takes so long to load a video and it sometimes doesnt update itself in time i could open the app times and its still updating
flawless perhaps too much info and the algo should include an input request about whether you want more or less of what youre talking about something such as a likedislike function
play store has to do something regarding musk trying to circle around the block function this morning i got an update saying that the block function will change by still letting us see accounts we have blocked but they can not interact with us this does little to nothing in terms of blocking a user on x
i thought i needed to update the app because i was scrolling and imagesvideos were just a gray block and never loaded in but reading the other comments just a lot of bugs and glitches
go to app for checking in on whats going on in the world from the voices publications or brands you want to follow easy to navigate and long form videosinterviews have been a bonus
""
app doesnt work if device is charging constantly shown awful ads ranging from the same temu ones or just bizarre things like kitchen appliances from unknown chinese app
i never face the problem since i installed but recently days i have facing problem like loading slow images are loading too slow i have done some tricks to solve but nothing worked please look in to this
block feature is being removed app has loading and caching issues it seems to serve the same tweets over and over pushes in app sales lots of unwanted ans vile porn appearing in trending topics
meh the app stops working randomly for me update its when im charging my phone please fix that if you can the app also crashes constantly when trying to text people on the app
questionable decisions have been made ever since the rebrand and with the upcoming changes regarding the blocking system i cant help but wonder if its even salvageable at this point
for some unknowable reason i and other android users arent allowed to turn of video auto advance lo and behold the faked video views are being touted by musky boy as a positive as if he didnt run the app into the dirt and then some
new tech interacting with st century humanity this is new ground for treckies a new stardate with a new captains log as we lurch into a fourth dimension and develop a seventh sense perhaps i might allocate a little more time for reflective practice with a re read of yuval harari s nexus and watch out for the trap of thinking too much and feeling too little for that way does madness lie we try once more to be more than men and become less than beasts but thanks for asking
with the newest update to blocking feature this app doesnt makes me feel safe anymore definitely beyond horrendous of a violation regarding users privacy the updates of the past year doesnt consider the majority of the users at all
feed is slow to load use to be fast but pictures or videos dont load everyone else knows all about the cesspool it is too hate is the default position here
it is one of the most interesting app with privacy controls also it is very useful one can be linked with any person of anywhere so this social media is appreciable even if it has a few limit
i have no idea is up after the update that pictues do not load even with or without wifi up down fiber insane to mess things up this bad with a update
twitter applications are the best applications for all we love it but sometimes twitter has been upgraded feature not whyso latest version of the twitter feed new features always updated not
very new to x and never read under prior name elon drew me in im able to get posts from people who i am interested in their thoughts and or investigations i havent received an overload of posts no weird out of the blue posts that i cant understand why i was sent as i read replies i am surprised that there are so many halfbrain radical anticonservative antiamericans posting negative comments on x elon seems to be posting both sides though i am not really interested in poor thinking
continues with worse and worse updates videos autoscroll for some reason half of the app doesnt load most of the time removing blocking filled with ads and bots
it keeps crashing although i tried to install it again and again sometimes during messaging some friends the app would suddenly crash even i already updated it
even after the updation im not able to watch any video properly like every videos stuck in between again and again and pictures quality is also very poor
app runs well great memes and if youre smart enough to not fall for obviously fake stuff the best source for news all the star reviews ive read from more recent seem like those people need to get new phones
yeah so this app just gets worse as time goes on and pretty sure the next terms and conditions is a playstore violation by allowing accounts you blocked to still see your posts guess someone mustve lost another custody battle bots are just as bad as ever
the app is always crashing having to restar it everytime it doesnt load properly the app gets worse every time
forget about the rebranding this app is going to the worst deepest darkets hell pit theres a lot of things that are wrong like editing profile takes a limit ads everywhere dms are not functioning well bots ts is just pay to win app now
keeps crashing on my samsung s utakes ages to work i have clear the cache and then starts workingbut still slow update still is slow even with updates
despite trying all solutions on line still failing to send kind of diametrically opposite to a reasonable expectation for a social media app and its only getting worse twitter is suffering because of ignoring the if it aint broke adage
after the new updated version i cant reply to any message on dm the apps will be forced to stop the message that i replied to didnt appear
videos autoscrolling without the option of turning that off are incredibly infuriating ads appear in a row sometimes
i have this issue where my ability to send replies and like posts becomes limited im hoping you can help clear up this glitch im having a difficult time trying to communicate and i feel disconnected when trying to express my opinions
this app is continuing to have bugs i cant barely get on board messagner what should i do updates r updated more times than any it takes a long minute to get keyboard up
this app is so poorly designed and keeps crashing every day hence the constant updates focus less on space x and more on x
this app has been driven into a rightwing hellhole by a dead beat father ignoring the poor quality moderation many good features like block will be ruined public likes no longer exists and the iconic twitter got changed into simply for no real valid reason you cant even say cisgender without being hit by a visibility limited please just move to bluesky at this point
stupid app only degrades more and more as time goes on wont refresh and gets stuck like that for hours on end makes me not even want to post or engage with anything anymore
the app will refuse to load any content occasionally making it unusable other apps are fine so i dont think my connection is the issue
since the changes x has been my goto app for foreign news and interesting discussions even though theres some issues i love the community notes feature and feel like it is the most reliable social media app out there
the ux got better edit aaaaand it keeps getting better professional mode fantastic especially on pc wider the screen you have the better great for osint community notes needs some work though
bots weird ads extremely pushy about their subscrition useless features and soon users that you blocked will still be able to see your posts we are assured they cant engage with them but is it a wise idea to have that feature
my first and foremost source for news one can decipher and filter out whats true and not true by doing a little bit of research its way better than the propaganda that mainstream media forces upon americans and people around the world there is plenty of content for all users with different interests extremely happy how it is managed and not as regulated like meta is this platform is not controlled by a politician
i felt x now very submergive and cool after its new avatar found lots hot stuff which i always appreciate as my preferences twitter alias x has made me to engage in it for searching content and chatting and also peep into it for gorgoeus gals thanks team x for making it a social media in the real sense
account suspended for no reason ive appealed or more times with absolutely no response this is completely ridiculous when i try to do a new appeal now it says the current account isnt suspended and i need to relogin why did you suspend my account ive done nothing wrong wheres my free speech everyone there just keeps ignoring me
since elon musk has bought twitter this platform is going downhill now with the desicion with changing how blocking work im more motivated than ever to not use it anymore and use bluesky instead btw bluesky doesnt require an invitation anymore
what is wrong with you apps loading image and video is too slow sometimes cant show it scroll down more and is it up again uninstall it bye annoying apps
awful slow glitchy and full of hate spew even if you dont follow someone your suggested content is gon na be hate fueled right wing propaganda bots are everywhere its been a complete deterioration of the app since musk bought it
its too slow i have an optimum internet connection with my starlink system and all other social media apps work great x lags and drags for new content
it refreshes every time you do anythingits almost unusable its so annoying and theres literally no way to control your feed anymoreprobably have to pay
x is borderline unusable becomes completely nonfunctional when your phone is charging the algorithm doesnt actually learn from what you do the rightwing nonsense ads and fake pornbot followers are out of control now theyre essentially rendering the block function useless and elon musk is a narcissistic moron who does the exact opposite of what the vast majority of the userbase of this app wants constantly shut the whole thing down this is ridiculous
app is not properly working on cellular networks even i have g network but it not loading data at that speed compared to other apps have
the best place to connect with software builders im learning some new technology daily faster and fresher than youtube suggestion the handle search algorithm could use an update to be a little fuzzy and consider some metadata
whenever i watch something then scroll the audio from the last video i watched keeps playing and it wont stop and even if i watch another vid the audio will just mix together
x always gets stuck on loading still persists even after closing and reopening the app meanwhile all other social medias dont have this problem
ive never had a problem with anything at all on this app everything functions as intended elon bought twitter and perfected it well itll never be perfect but evolving anyways its great i find so many people who use x as their primary source of news
i have just started using the x app and i find it a great app easy to navigate through the options cant wait to see what improvements they will make or bring to the app coz i know that they are always trying to make things better for everyone keep up the great work
smooth and adjustable clicks seem to change what content you view a wide range of media compared to other apps no qualms about it
by far the most entertaining social media app the trending section hasnt worked for me since a few months ago that was a really helpful feature
app keeps crashing on the pixel pro it closes especially when im typing in the dms and then i have to start typing again please fix
its starting to break tos with the way its changing its blocking functions to allow the blocked to see yet not interact with the account defeats the whole purpose of the function which is to protect ones privacy in not letting the people u dislike or have wronged u to peek at ur stuff yk
they are changing the block functionality making this an extremely unsafe app it is broken and terribly managed while being used as a tool to push the agendas of its current owner no one is safe here
x is the best social media ive come across but an alternative should be taken on if your account was suspended mistakenly its like impossible to get back your accounts after disabled my account cant be retrieved now
after elon take over the twitter and turned it into x there are a lot of tos breaking the block will no longer function normally people who are blocked can still view the tweets of people who block them unless we are private as elon claims they still unable to interact with it this still could lead to old incident such as doxxing terrorizing and mass reporting for harmless stuff just by screenshot the tweet this endangered small artist reputation along with the noncon ai training
ive had this app since i was and this app has become the worst ive seen it crashing dms freeze so you cant type or go backsigned outcreate an account glitch please fix this app samsung
the app keeps having issues when i log in on both my phones everyday it doesnt load just an all round useless app i dont know if its the app or the x its self but just a problematic app
hasnt been working for days now wont let me type messages keeps freezing already deleted and reinstalled twice no updates to try either
app works perfectly ui takes a little to figure out the feeds love the news open policy it is the only reason i came back and became a daily user
its unusable now previously it was a great place to get news and follow communities i had interest in now its all just racism bots death and elons tweets even if i dont follow him i left facebook for this but now its just the same thing
great but id like to see a hundred letter count sometimes you have just a little extra youd like to say and up or down approval emoji of and article or a like and angry emoji we dont love every post or article
i would give it a zero if possible never works properly videos just decide not to load anymore app just shut down out of no where app is just buggy for being a million dollar company
this is not signing me up for twitter the service is really bad i feel frustrated with twitters management its the worst service ive experienced this app doesnt work for long
i used to love this app really did twitter was fun and less rigid if you wanted someone who isnt your cup of tea to never look at your stuff block them now theyll bw able to see it whats the point of a block button
it contains many ads and it like the operators are not working for it cause when i suggest not to like the ads it keeps on coming again and again to my timeline poor x better than twitter
hello how are you doing today i have a suggestion if i may i think twitter or x should have reelslike tiktok for an example people dont tend to read alot you cant say everything with in a tweet or post masses in the future wont read alot also eventually the masses control the product x need reels thats just my opinion feel free to ignore it i dont have any proof anyway best regards
i have been using x for over a decade now and in my observation the experience has been outstanding i am happy with the features it comes with and the platform it has made available for people to participate in a variety of activities
fix the issue with dms i try to access a group im in constantly thrown out constantly crashes app is identified by my phone as having bugs
overall good i feel its a little hard to navigate but it allows freedom of speech while trying not to spread misinformation
videos dont stop if you watch a series of videos the audio from preceding videos begin to overlap and play at the same time
recent days facing issues on x its says cant retrieve post at this time although my internet is stable all the other social media sites are working pretty well but this x sucks
they just rolled out an update allowing people who have been blocked to see the accounts of the ones who blocked them feels like that goes against the tos of playstore plus too many ad and issues with the app as updates come out
twitter is a good platform app also but a lot of problems arise in it my id gets suspended without any fault and for the last few days my latest tweet is not showing on my ideven after doing all the clear updates please check my id and fix this problem
truly stupid theyre changing the blocking functionality where people can still see what youre tweeting despite having said person blocked most of these updates elon has rolled out are just straight up downgrades trying to make us buy that blue check mark subscription aint no way imma pay for something that was free already
mostly lots of improvements over what its been in the past and im glad the journey isnt over and progress isnt stymied extra appreciation for commitment to a consistent innovation
lets get this out of the way im not calling it x ignoring the rampant neonazis on this site its slow and filled to the brim with bugs major bug fixing and reworking is needed to even come close to a usable experience
fix your ad i dont want to see that diva production ad and i keep clicking i dont like this ad button but it keeps appearing every seconds
in less than month i have been flagged at least twice with no explanation followers were all taken to this is not good at all very very very disappointed
lots of trumpwing garbage but good stuff as well depends whowhat you follow no ads on the pc due to addons i use the app on my phone and tablet are a different story loaded with ads
more truth less lying edit under new ownership x formerly the corruption app twitter has improved individual liberty throughout the world its not perfect but its dramatically better
really good app could use a bit of fine tuning and a few extra features but all n all great place to express yourself without too much fear removal
i am giving one star because others are able to see the number of accounts they blocked and muted but i am unable to see it even though i updated thrice after it why you are not giving that feature to me
i use x for lots of things mostly i pay attention to the news i read here and follow content creators that im interested in the app works well and i am quite satisfied i want to say thank you to the staff at x for keeping the content uncensored i can choose for myself what i want to read about instead of letting the advertisers and management decide for me
everytime i click on any vedio it doesnt play though network condition is quite good here dont know wether its bug or something else pls fix it
well it seems to me on this app that you see far less of the stuff you actually click like on and a freakin whole lot more of the stuff you actually click the not intetested in option or stuff that you block or mute
changing the block feature is idiotic it worked fine just before clearly a way to push propaganda and that will be the final nail in the coffin for me ill stop using twitter if block doesnt function like a block anymore
i am accessing x every day it is a really great source for me for everything from breaking news to the latest on the campaign trail to simply checking in on my various topics of interest its all good thank you elon musk for this awesome service it is the best by far news source on this planet and soon mars as well awesome
bought the premium and cant even click to verify within the days stated to confirm keeps giving an error message then refunded because even i opened the app to confirm but still got the error whats the point
great app consistently up to date while my feed doesnt always reflect my interests its been much better in the last year than it has in the past very happy with the platform
i like the information i just wish you had a how videos beginner need to learn more advanced because i personally know it would be better to learn other things
when i tried to watch a video and when it keeps lagging the video that i press will not be shown and it was replaced by ads dont like the new twitter bring back the old twitter
the app constantly logs me out for no discernable reason ive tried everything except uninstalling and reinstalling to try and fix it but no dice
x is incredibly easy to navigate i enjoy the access to free speech and expression being able to see others views on every topic is really underrated grok is fun too
to many issues ive used this app many times just recently re downloaded it and everytime i use it its stalls and crashes now its kinda ridiculous
full of chinese garbage ads fake scam game ads every tweets video playback is terrible with constant buffering and low quality live streamplay is very unintuitive
elonhas saved x and the world from censorship some minor tweaks and improvements would make it even better but x gives a voice to the voiceless onwards and upwards
its an observed platform a few more posts and l will be dialed into the singularity of things as the ai bots are plentiful and the battle is on a tilted roof uphill slide still entertaining and informative so it gets a positive nod
constantly jumps away from what youre currently reading just to never find back the tweet its getting worse and feels intentional by now
i enjoyed this app it has different subscriptions and i can follow people that im interested in and its not censored i really enjoy elon musk also theres not a bunch of scams like one other platform that is inundated with misinformation
i was using twitter for so long but after it change into x it doesnt work properly i cant log out nor log in anymore if by mistaken i log out it doesnt even recognise my email id anymore
overall its an interesting social media platform there seems to be less censorship than other platforms so its good to see they are actually protecting our rights and freedom i would like them to continue to innovate and help enable financial freedom and self sovereignty globally
the new owner has forcibly pushed neo nazi memes conspiracy theories and overt racism into my for you page i have spent so much time blocking accounts to get my feed to not look like a klan meeting and it just never ends the final straw is he is now breaking the block feature in a way that will allow people to stalk or harass you even if you have them blocked because they can still see everything you post unbelievably poor user experience the ui is clunky and slow the app crashes
there is no counter for this application even though i am just running the app using other peoples entities in order to follow a privacy standard and to manage stackflow the transparency was totally fine for me because its wont do anything for me anymore im a student but only make a learning in those information that could find everywhere until i realized that some part of the information were false and totally misleading that could be harmful for knowledge lol
latest update or whatever u did the last day or so has made it absolutely unusable cant dm crashes constantly just absolutely terrible
what a garbage app this has turned into account got suspended i have no idea what rule i broke and everything i try to fix it or apply for an appeal just gives me the same something isnt right try your request again later its been like this for days now what happened
musk seems to be getting things done now from a choice of subscription packages to new features for everyone i previously commented about good security but im changing my mind on that as musk is rumoured to be getting rid of the block and mute facilities if hes such a free speech champion he needs to remember people have a right to refuse to listen democracy works both ways the five stars are fast diminishing four
its probably the only app in the universe to have free speech around the world it connects the world together free information without the news channel if youre afraid of disinformation well news channel have the best propaganda on that do your research before your conclusions free speech freedom lets you hear it from both sides whos right whos wrong most of the time free speech wins mainstream media will lose out if they dont join the free speech train
all of a sudden it doesnt upload any form of moving media from gallery gifs videos i tried everything it doesnt work restart clear cache force stop update change size change format you name it i did it and nothing worked please fix it
my account gets locked or logged out often like every other day never had these issues back in the twitter days how can an app this mature not maintain a logged in account implement something like passkey and stop making the experience of using this app horrible
works alright but has annoying quirks sometimes itll refresh on its own after opening and auto translator will be broken for hours on end and suddenly start working again
first of all this app makes use of peoples post to train ai stealing artists art without their consent as a part of terms and service it not even possible to reject it second of all there is a community called shtwt that got banned the reason i have an issue with this is that yes a lot of them would reinforce doing things like that but a decently large part of that community was people offering help and therapy you took away some peoples outlets maybe do a backround check before ban
elon has ruined and is still ruining this app more and more each passing day with the latest update effectively destroying the block feature i hope googleapple and all other app stores consider taking action this is not okay
fun informativeit is what we make it and allows a fully explorative discourse which can be challenging if were looking for more depth but will be just as rewarding if we persevere as with anything of worth and greater value in life
i am glad that x has made those changes of getting rid off many fake accounts and spam there might be a few lingering in there but i will say about are gone aside from that the app is a great place to be in
works well not as buggy as it used to be more and more people are coming back to x the community comment section is excellent the extended video and live x feature called spaces is awesome
very useful very accurate and a wealth of information news is also available at express speed it also helps a lot to make you laugh when the mood is off
the worst thing about this x app is the fact that they just allow scammers on the app they suspend users without actually verifying youre a real human the x criminals collect your money for a verified blue marker and they still suspend without notice i have deleted and uninstalled that useless x app elon musk should be jailed for this the previous owner did a better job
i bought the subscription but still not used the premium version cause every time ask confirm but nothing happened resolved the issue i got the error every time its worst experience
ill give it three stars cant believe it when it comes to editing you needed premium but im finally back on track to my previous twitter account and the security is good with verification
loading posts is extremely slow and almost never shows up but when it comes to ads its extremely fast bring back the old twitter
im editing this post right now wan na say i totally disappointed with x i use this platform since twitter but these constant new updates makes it more laggingloadingerror even though my internet line is good why please fix it for real do not only read our reviews
too many ads every messages in the feed is another ad too many bots this app has gotten worse over the last years
cant get help through app without paying for premium their website contact us is very restricted on options to select for submiting a ticket cant login to any apps i used twitterx for currently
great app for people like me free speech but the problem is when i change other countries for exploring it changes but only showing the trending related to my country then whats the use of exploring other countries please fix it
fix your app first login issues unnecessary tests to prove my identity everytime i login bugs and errors all the time what are you guys doing instead of fixing your app stop releasing useless updates and make it stable like it used to be
good app gives plenty of political information and free of charge what could one ask for better user friendly even khomeini posts on it however i still prefer the name twitter and to know that a human has tweeted dont like x as name of app
after new update it wouldnt let me watch videos and always said playback error i tried to clear cache restart phone exit and re open everything fix this lil bru
the app just keeps getting worse and worse all previous ratings have shown just how frustrated the recent updates were and i believe the block and ai update was the last straw for me
i enjoy using the app its got its naughty sorts but you just have to negotiate your way away from them the naughty sorts are there unfortunately and always will be the app itself is perfectly fine though
ive had a tremendously good time with speaking to so many people and getting into conversations that i otherwise wouldnt have been able to its a lot of fun having serious conversations and other conversations which are just filled with jokes and humor of all sort i enjoy relaxing after work spending a few hours here
having a problem with opening a message it keeps freezing the app and i have to close it and i can only go to the web browser to reply to that person
likevery intresting it keeps me updated very well on sports and music and news love this your always in the loop when it comes to these topics just watch the people who send you requests so you dont get taken others wise its fun to be on x
imagine using the not interested in this post and muteblock feature but the algorithm thinks you like this topic and so theyll give you even more of it useless app and site not worth it staying here
media dont load most of the times and the app doesnt refresh very poor experience in recent times
having issues messaging friends where when tapping on the text box the app crashes so far not such a good experience
x has a completely different vibe from twitter and the algorithm actually shows me things im interested in rather than just corporate sponsored garbage
elon keeps breaking the app too many random changes they will block your account without hesitation if you brake any of their rules and you can not appeal i deleted my main account and i recommend it to you all
there no account recovery options and not user friendly and also i dont know why people use this app anymore people need alternative solutions this kind of unresponsive apps and services unfortunately this popularity push us to create account of this st but it dont also supports haha
the app hangs a lot and dm always unresponsive there is a bug in the app its too sad that this app with time become worse and worse
the quality of twitter has drastically gon down hill since leon took over its so laggy constantly crashes and sometimes doesnt even function at all ntm its infected with magakkk propaganda bots
i like the premium but it doesnt seem to load all the features all the time its cool to have a live stream of elon musks thought process or aoi its probably unhealthy but i feel like its healing me in some way and also breaking me in others
only issue it happens sometimes but content is slow loading like it doesnt show or load pics or videos sometimes other than that its good app
poor experience cant even login everytime when trying to login something went wrong try again later its been month facing the issue cant even create a new account also
x is the best app for getting uncensored instant news and opinions far superior to twitter by a long shot no longer are opinionsviews censored because they dont line up with the mainstream media many will hate on x because of this but they still use it go figure this is a great app with many benefits beyond socializing it runs very smoothly and doesnt crash that is an outright lie you wont be censored here for having the wrong opinions that bugs some people all are welcome
ever since elon took over nothing loads i am constantly having to switch between data and internet to get anything to load and i usually have to switch between the two in the same thread to get the comments and the post to load
my profile wont update it just gets an error i tried allowing all permissions clear my x data and updated the app fix this twitter
accurate information i can rely on i connect with all sorts of diverse people i can enjoy some memories from the past through music i have a voice in this huge world
the app gets worse every update theres currently a bug where the app doesnt work if you are charging your phone it sucks
changed my password and then it logged me out when i tried to log in i was given a hard time finally got access but all my bookmarks and people i am followimg are gone cant look up my account by my phone number even after sending me a verificastion code to my phone number
im new to this app i find it is informative but sometimes my feeds are all the same im hoping to include some non political views and entertainment value that is more uplifting than this to my day looking forward to that
im pretty sure this is breaking playstores tos elon wants to change the block features so that blocked people can still see each others posts which is very dangerous in cases of stalking please review the app and determine if its breaking playstores tos
hello this app is everything you wish but i am disappointed by their support without any reason x blocked my account access and now i am unable to access my account i am using x from last to years i am not getting text code from last days mfa messed up my account which caused my account to get temporarily block and there is no way to get help from x team
worst experience even having high internet band speed video does not play smoothly whereas at the same time youtube videos were running on k is it a trick to make users buy premium
this app keeps freezing on me shutting down or just really laggy even the one i have downloaded thay i rarely update on an older phone works better
tried to sign into my account after reinstalling the app x said it would send a confirmation email to my gmail with a code minutes later the code arrived but the app had already timed out pathetic
there is a massive bot problem on the app like without fail like clock work the same acounts or accounts with no post aside from a certain kind will flood the trending page its absurd and the changes to the app literally make it worse everytime
terrible app that pushes elonns agenda onto you even if you block or arent interested in the content full of hatred attempts to push you towards paying for basic functionality that exists for free on other platforms do not support it
xs new tos is violating the privacy of its users any creative work posted on x could be copied reproduced and downloaded for the sake of ai training without the owners permission this is unacceptable
it wont let me text my friends the send button doesnt even work on my phone i thought it was just a glitch or a bug but its a general issue for me
lots of people complain about how toxic x is but for me its the only place i can connect with some of the greatest minds in the world get amazing updates on science and health as well as receive breaking news and insightful commentary
why do i get recommend violent content i just saw a second video of a person getting shot and killed i didnt even know what was happening why am i recommended such content this app has become super scary and dodgy i hope it gets taken down
latest update in android is causing major issues in messages cant update them and difficulty posting doubt e musk cares or will fix it but this review may help people realise its x and not their phones or signal
absolutely sucks not only does the app crash all the time the block feature is now practically pointless i do not enjoy knowing that people i have blocked can see my posts just because my account is public
constantly changing the app to fuel the owners ego bugs all the time and is using its sheer number of ads to bother people into paying for a social media account
major improvements of late sorting comments creating lists and community notes have been great would love a way to make building lists easier not one by one
the block feature is being removed which allows for stalkers and harassars to have an open platform not to mention unconsensual feeding our images to its ai grok do not use it is not worth it
it just gets worse and worse stops working doesnt load posts doesnt work for no reason then i check for updates there is nothing
the sound on this app is always overlapping watching video and listen to another lots and lots of fake stuff and posts voicing my opinion got me asked to take a bot test i think the app sucks
for you feed just instantly got flooded with fight videos and other trashbot generated content out of nowhere completely ruined the experience fix the algo
the chat system always crashing everytime i opened ive been tried redownload it several of times but its keep happening
i enjoy the ease of use being able to get fast cs help from companies following experts in my field and finding news now let me hide things i dont care about in trending sports entertainment and the app would be perfect
fix this app already the issues im having with it are ridiculous lol you need to fix this bufferingloading issue its so ridiculous and slows down my phone i have to either wait a whole hour or restart my phone then twitter will work smh
bug bug bug day i think times only loading the tweets and videos properly after that all time its not working its working like g network connection irritated
its a way to communicate with people in a different manner i think it had improved my journaling skills a lot and its preety good for finding clients as a video editor too highly recommended
its fine and degree of freedom is more than other ssn but not being able to list posts in chronological order really sucks
im so frustrated that x keeps constantly crashing on me if it doesnt get fixed asap i will delete it i might just delete it today
its getting very bad with me i have logged in more than times with this automatic logout verification problem various problems are showing its really sad
i love x you get the news so quick i love the fact the way you can directly follow others and can follow who you want based on their profiles the only thing that i would like better is quicker removal of bots and multiple accounts
even when paying premium you can not access ai can not talk to a customer service rep and can not appeal a ban so im paying money to not be allowed to use an ai platform i paid for i didnt pay to use social media i paid for ai this is bs
been facing glitches using messaging on twitterapp gets frozenthen closes now none of the photos are loadingits not an internet issue since all other apps are working finefix it asap
it leaves a lot to desire the posts on feed arent current and sometimes out of order my art posts on comments wont go through the blocking system is a joke why do we need big walls of text saying this person limits who can view their posts if they block or i block they and their posts should be invisible to you and vice versa we want a better blocking system like tumblr they should increase the age limit or restrict teens to their side like instagram theyre causing problems too
so my previous account got hacked and it was flagged by x which is understandable because the person who hacked it was promoting crypto and spamming with it but ive opened a different account and now anytime i log in you guys logs me out almost immediately why
bugs the advertisement music running in back ground even after closing the app something is not right
october opening app it now constantly hangs for over ten minutes whenever it refreshes going from bad to worse to ludicrous for over a month this app has become painfully slow whats his face needs to rehire a programming staff because the mess hes created sucks big time
i enjoy this social media platform because i can be involved as little or more as i please there is also the ability to private chat if one desires way better than face book in my humble opinion ive done both
x are not privacy at all after change block option thats are rude for user who dont want to see content they dont like and this x is not good for artists
this app is going down the drain it feels like every week theres a new feature that makes it more unusable than the last used to be a fun app to use now i barely want to keep it
i have to keep reinstalling the app for it to work properly a app of this level should not need this every time something goes wrong nothing should be going wrong
x is great the ui needs a lot of work to make it more usable great that you can voice your opinions without fake fact checks
this site is useless for alter like me why they accept fake report by someone who also alter like in this site they always do flood report by a group of an alter to get suspended the account if they report i hope before you suspended account make they report real not fake news then the file appeal of this site is useless you never give second chance to get back the account that suspended
horrible decisions altering the block feature rendering it less effective attempting to take information to train ai to name a few
very interested i like lost temples and our culture if it shared it goes world over our comments also liked by funds around the world so i like twitteryes i like tweeterit is my daily life i enjoy all i selected interested topic and following many talented persons sharing views many brilliant persons liked my comments iam patriotic persontweeter is very helpful yo share each others in this tweet brings world closerif u allow me to continue tweeter is my friend ur choice
i do find the fees to subscribe a bit tough because im on limited income if i continue to enjoy content what i can see ill save up
having trouble while using this app have cleand my storge done clear cache etc etc but still x is hanging or corruption in my cell giving these errors isnt responding close app and wait
this app crashes every single time i open it messages doesnt load properly video playback errors this app was great but musk deer ruined it
too many bugs timeline can not be refreshed oftenly not showing dp pic vid automatic nect video keep crashing unusable
oct your freakin ads are crashing the app aug are you serious four ads in a row july as if the ver isnt bad enough spams ads now appear every tweets i dont like this ad function is utterly useless only a decoration at this point
holy this app is garbage now every time i open it in my mind im hoping it will not freeze its like playing russian roulette with this app and i use a pretty good phone before any hardware excuse
group chat keeps loading but solo dms are working just fine please fix the issue edit yall getting rid of the block feature whats the point of privacy then this app is useless at this rate i would rate it star is i could
have paid for twitter blue tick days back i waited for many days but i didnt received my bluetick neither i did receive any refund whole other users got blue ticks in days my tick was delayed pending and not issued i waited so long for a response for x premium and x support but they have ignored or not response to any one of my mails i feel like twitter scammed me they have taken my payment and not taken any action on it i never got scammed in a such a worse manner from a social med
it was working good but now i got g phone with g connection the refreshing is good but i am not able to see photos videos and uploading is too slow and still not uploading somehow the videos just uploading is failed
do not listen to the whiny ideologues that are leaving negative reviews theyre mad that they cant silence their opposition this app works amazing and i use it dailymin of hrs day and i experience none of these bugs or glitches theyre making up there is nothing better than free speech thank you elon you have truly saved freedom of expression and humanity owes you big time
it takes two years to load feeds and notifications and comments on my device becoming unusable with each new update
its good but i can not literally change my account type i cant change my profile picture sometimes said always an error occured since the owner of x changed these things always occured to me please fix your app
the platform has just been absolutely taken over by bots the comments section is barely functional any more on top of that you have the full screen auto playing ads
my account was hacked right before it became x idk when but i didnt use twitter much now its x and i want to use the app and cant cuz it was hacked and suspended ive submitted several appeals and never heard anything back its been over a year and i just want to delete my account and i cant even do that i want to delete all the post from the hack but i cant even do that i wanted to see what all the hype was about and to this day i still cant
been using this app years now and its pathetic that the bug that makes nothing load no matter what is still not even fixed yet in starting to lose hope on this app
not interesting anymore it keeps on crashing constantly everyday i cant load my timeline and comments in peace anymore can you please fix this asap
doesnt load about half of the time and the other half the media struggles its not my connections because i dont have this issue with other apps
can not retrieve messages at this time every time i open the app while charging my phone when adding users to list suggestions do not load
i cant believe the improvements from worst to first the last few years have been i give this app stars for excellence above and beyond i normally only give stars to leave room for improvement
somehow took a decent product and quickly made it unbearable to use block every blue check theyre always engagement farming
nearly everything wrong with this app owned by an idiotic billionaire with an ego bigger than his wallet amplifies farright ideologies and nazi rhetoric awful ui design its officially called x the block feature is being changed to be useless ads everywhere constantly the messaging system is still lacking videos autoscroll to completely unrelated and often inappropriate content verified accounts are the worst yet are prioritised in replies even though theyre either bots or brainrot memes
everytime am watching any video on x had stucked very badly this issue am facing since last months after updatingvery bad experience please give some solution over the issue
i am enjoying using x app but having a bad experience using chat i cant chat with my friends as the always crashes then i got to option to wait to eternity or close to have the same bad experience so please fix this erorr asap thanks
new block feature allows the blocked person to continue viewing your posts but not interact with themwhat thats like a restraining order saying a stalker cant talk to you but they can stare at you through your houses windows
timeline wont load when my phone is charging constant crashing and when the timeline wants to work it would reset said timeline
whenever i play a video on full screen or expand a thread and then go back to homepage the feed gest refreshed everytime it is so annoying
newest update makes the block function useless someone you blocked cant interact with you but they can still see what you post making it easier to stalk and harass you even mass false report you doesnt this violate the play stores tos
cant say i share the same experience as others have app works perfectly fine for me on an s with the exception of spaces sometimes being buggy
pretty easy to navigate compared to other social media apps really good i dont spend a lot of time on social media in general but x is so intuitive to use when i do get on there its a breeze
sometimes when i open the app it refuses to refresh and it keeps doing that several times nowadays i hope it gets fixed soon
not like any other cheap social media initially choose some standard content to watch and get the best experience also developers should ban nudity from the platform
something is wrong with twitter because it keeps crashing and i cant tell if it logged me out bc im still able to get notifications that someone messaged me
id put stars if it were possible instead of putting oit new useless updates focus on fixing the existing bugs in your platform now pictures videos and tweets wont load
cant log in deleted app reinstalled and found i can not log in ridiculous changed password successfully just goes back to sign in screen repeatedly
appp over the past few days has been crashing and its saying the app has a big so am waiting for the new update to see if it will work
the app keep on crash the photos and videos wont load and play twittet become worse and worse since elon buy it fix this
what else do you expect from twitter been experiencing a number of issues since elon got his hands on the property notably the app is running slower images are loading at half the time they were before and some of my dms arent working
great app sometimes a little difficult to navigate hence the stars instead of growing pains itll get better over time
a big fat zero or negative it just keeps on loading and loading and loading but never refreshes be it the post or timeline app is really bad tell musk to sell it back
have had zero glitches wonderfully improved experience since elon took over the only way to get real time news updates usually informed a couple days before mainstream media catches up
completely hostile to users free use of ai content misinformation tos breaks disturbing content and is now full of bots not worth the time anymore we all know why this is so leave the site to its decline
horrible possibly illegal updates human made artwork is now being fed to an ai machine without consent the block system is no longer functioning so blocked users can still see my account the app crashes every seconds its just horrendous
stars because there isnt an edit button i notice there is still quite a bit of censoring though not as much as before my biggest gripe is that my page was never returned as promised after musk bought twitter
keeps giving me notifications about tweets from people i dont follow and about content that i dont care about or find mildly offensive the changes to the block feature are ridiculous a complete husk of how twitter used to be years ago
used to be so great now its full of ads and bots and features that were free are now disappearing behind a paywall
worst application of twitter failed authentication process this is loosing interest in using your twitter account cant even recognise the original user and upon charging extra for your stupid subscription never like before worst app
refreshes randomly when im reading a tweet sometimes force starts the feed from the top i prefer scrolling up and for some stupid reason nothing loads when i plug my charger in
listen i hate for the fact that i cant follow trends based on the location i set in my x app ever since it was updated i live in the netherlands and im not interested in their trending topics i need trends based on what i set my location to be fix it
they are making the block option completely useless this is a safety issue since blocked accounts will be able to see everything you post even if you block them be safe out there
buggy app freezes and crashes every time also removed block feature is a bad move revert it if you dont want your app to die
the app doesnt work if im charging my phone stupidest thing ive experienced with an app it always crashes when im trying to dm anyone
it crashes at least twice when i try to open it and if i do anything but scroll down my timeline it crashes
logs out for no reason automatically jumps back to a previous position while scrolling refreshes for no reason
great app for reliable honest information from the best and brightest alot of these star reviews arent because of the app but their own phones performance bugs and resentful manipulation yet they blame it on the app truth
images and videos rarely load anymore and the app frequently stops loading altogether extremely unreliable
great app my request would be an option to have the latest content appear first in feed maybe it is available and i just dont know it
the change with the block button really puts people who have stalkers in a very dangerous situationand i feel as though corporate does not care hiding the ability to fully block your profile from someone behind a paywall seems like exploitation of users
very slow it keeps loading for so long especially for pictures im using both iphone and android and its so slow missing the old twitter
this app sucks can not retrieve posts sudden log out absolutely frustrating comeon elon youve advanced in space cant you just improve this app
still unable to change my profile picture since the change to x small thing but super frustrating and annoying
twitter is dope overall the issue is see is when a page is blocked for adult artistic expression please leave artists alone art is subjective expression and appreciation is personal this should be a safe for place for adult artistic expression and appreciation
monetization program is great but they need to make premium support better no ticket system lots of accounts are suspended without any warning
trash suspended my premium account without notice and for no reason dont install this trash something is going very wrong with it elon claims to support free speech and yet his platform is impinging on my first amendment right to free speech guess its still run by cucks
this app is among other apps not loading using my home wifi but it is perfectly fine using mobile data on the other hand it is also working fine in my ipados
i have happily migrated from most social media services to x it has no substitute and is unparalleled with its respect to freedom of speech and thought premium features are extremely useful and represent great value i highly recommend all to migrate to x and boycott woke mind virus censorship and assault of freedom of thought
often has trouble loading very frustrating if you can actually read the content its great
mobile loading is trash and freezes for hours at a time basically unusable now need more devs or servers to fix this
i detest the ads popping up when i am watching a post i barely want to be in here or look at a video posted get rid of your annoying pop up ads
please bring back stories also we need a way to be able to search bookmarks and i think its about time reposts are on a separate tab than posts
the app keeps crashing its litterally unusable atp always when videos from ads start playing or when im dming someone
it keeps on crashing i cant send messages without it crashing theres too much bots fix this
there is no warning message no notice and x is wasting years of hard work in a moment by suspending the account this is a very wrong method first give a warning to the person whose account you are suspending if he does not agree then suspend him this is the dictatorial attitude of x which is going to cost x heavily one day note this
this was a good app for everyone until commercial gutting greed took it over and completely remade this once fine app into a glitzy glittery ad campaign for mostly stage performers rejected by instacrap and facistbook our fav civil rights removers gutting the st ammendment to our constitution which has stood the test of time and legal challenges facistbook seeks to circumvent such trival obstacles like the freedom of speech in favor of the mighty commity substandards no on fb
it takes more than minutes to load the posts when i open it it keeps buffering every time i try to use it
whoever thought scrolling to play a new random video after your video finishes playing that is the worst thing twitter has ever done it is incredibly annoying
ads every five posts okay fine ads that autoplay and you cant turn off literally dangerous for people with seizures but sure making the block feature useless and makinf the websiteapp even more dangerous for victims youre out of your mind congrats you took something and you ruined it
it keeps crashing and freezing elon ruined this app im updating my review its getting worse i would give it less than a star if i could
i really like this app but i cant change my profile photo i tried many times but if i refresh my page the photo will go back to the original photo pls fix this
a side effect of promoting free speech is that the app is filled with racist homophobicxenophobic misogynistic people and corn maybe im just naive and easily manipulated but this app has really effected my mental health only incels who will never be loved use this app
tons of bugs keep getting worse since late of the only reason that makes me still using this app is my friends are since therere no alternative choices yet
app works well and gives all sides of the news including the underside at the cost of some repetition my goto news app i choose who i listen to rather than the collusive bloc of main stream media
i am facing issue since i downloaded it when i open it something wrong try written as come on the screen and also tell that the account is suspended but i give many times appeal to unsuspended my account but no reaction please solve my account problem dear thank
the app crashes times i try to use it currently cant even use my dms because of how much its crashing disappointed to say the least
honestly the app was great before elon musk took the site over now its just a cesspool of racism homophobia transphobia and antisemitism then theres the issue of bots running rampant and intrusive ads and ads that are completely irrelevant like republican party ads on top of the site being bloated with features that are either completely pointless like tweet view counts or the disabling of likes to intrusive stuff like ai being trained with your tweet activity
i am unable to open x account please x team fix my problem i give it stars but if my problem is solved then i will give it stars problem is see whats happening in the world right now create account
pretty soon they will be allowing blocked accounts to view your profile ill be deleting the app when that starts i also hope that the app store removes this app from the store being it will be violating their policies
the new update has pretty much completely removed the point if blocking other users making it hard for people to have privacy
i just installed this app im learning how to use it i would h ave posted no rating but that was not a choice i may give a higher rating once i learn more ive never understood being asked to rate an app ive never even used yet
stop videos playing in random order repeat the video youre watching as before app has trouble switching from wifi and data
i used to love this app but the changes being made like the messanger the verified and the block all changing to sometimes useless sometimes worse is getting to be unbearable
app frequently missed calculate my engagement as suspicios where always subject me to authenticate if am a human annoying verifying image may be reasonable but images its time consuming considering the size of the image cant hardly visible
half the time app doesnt load the other half of the time its mostly ads or bots the fall off is real
this app has gone to hell since elon bought it and removing the block feature was the last staw there is no good reason to do this it will just let stalkers keep track of their victims easier
its so bad the app just never works every single day when i try to open it it refuses to even load anything even when my wifi is perfectly normal god please get rid of elon
can not send private messages without the app crashing basic functionality doesnt even work any more
the upcoming block update is a massive mistake that will ruin any sense of privacy and enable rampant abuse the website has become useless for finding any reliable news or information and prioritizes rage bait terrible app
the most informative and quite fun social media news platform x is constantly evolving and adding new and exciting stuff
its a good applicationit provide uptodate information it helps to agree and disagree with others opinion so ans i can create my own ideas its very difficult to get that from other social media apps this is a helpful application
one app i cant stay without thank you developers simply the best of all apps even though they keep on blocking and verifying if i am a human x could that be fixed once and for all
uh actual free speech ftw of course you have to filter some of the idiots but that is the price of free speech some idiots some people you disagree withno filtering in that case some you do agree with plenty of irreverence and lots of interesting stuff like history geology uapufo news comp sci and on get it and pay for it to aupport it as the island in the aea of googles facebooks and othe thought police orga
whenever i am trying to join a space it gives an error as my account is suspended when i click on restore it says your account is not suspended but i will not be able to join any space
i have been a premium subscriber for months every single day it tells me that im not a premium subscriber i cant download videos i cant do anything on there but im paying it and theyre saying i need to manage my subscription its on your end give me my money back
app barely works stuck trying to load feed for hours everything else works fine on my phone bit x cant load a simple photo
the app getting worse and worse keep loading for a few hours based on others user comment they also experience the same issue twitter much better before when it become x its mean die
news sequence kid makes plane tracking app elon says stop tracking my private her ill give you money kid says no elon buys twitter and says kids is violating ts since then i need to prove im human almost every other app launch or get forcefully logged out every other launch features like random sort or latest feed downloads are now behind a paywall the blue checkmark anyone can purchase now
the lack of user control is disgraceful i do not wish to see random violent videos instantly after the conclusion of a video i selected
i tried to subscribe to nishant kumar from x and i paid rupees for subscription but it didnt get activated today being th day someone told me they also faced similar situation and got the refund back i expect to get rupees refund immediately thank you
its a fraud app for first time i bought a premium with and for that i made new account and as i was using it just after min they suspended my account when i didnt even break any rules and top of that i had premium yet they suspended it without warning and it was new account on top of that
just wont load half the time videos seem to either not load or just wont play theres a massive gap for a new social media platform i genuinely believe twitter x is being intentionally killed slowly
honestly the app just sucks now twitter being bought by that tesla guy just killed the whole vibe now they are changing the blocking setting so people you blocked can still see what you post which makes no sense also why did they copy xfinity logo kind of i miss the old twitter give me back the blue bird
for the last six months the app only works half the time tweets and messages just wont load and all functions just cease for no reason
very slow and not working properly video cant play refreshing problem sometimes message show but not open and when phone on charging than x is not working please check this problem
app is becoming incredibly slow bug ridden original posts without mentions are only showing up in replies tab
the functionality is great but even better is the freedom of speech and expression it has become my favorite social media platform especially for unbiased news engaging entertainment and peoples opinions thank you elon
i like using it but loading for grok and even simple pictures takes forever no other site takes this long to load anything even at k my internet is blazing fast so i know it is not client side
x is the best news source community of people free speech is important i get to read views of people all over the world news from real journalist learn about history research different political views make connections with real people
used to love this app until elon bought it everythings gone downhill since then glad i stopped posting months ago by the way the block update sucks the point of blocking is to keep someone away why would i want them to see my posts
good app but i wish in the next update you can add a feature that we can remove followers that we dont want to follow back cause i feel uncomfortable that a fake account follows twitter acc i hope u really consider it thankyou
this app still fails to load every single day for periods of time even when internet connection is stable and uninterrupted please fix this already
good app and works well but when i close x then reopen it doesnt open where i leaved it and it opens at top of the page so i need to scroll down and try and find where i was
my x app keep crashing i deleted it earlier and now i can not open it and even log in it keeps on crashing please fix this issue
awesome news that cant be found from mainstream media great commentarors memes and video footage from current events love the experience
frequent crashes videos straight up breaking search system is terrible for you page filled replies to private accounts insane amounts of propaganda there is genuinely no point in reading comments anymore because theyre filled with the same copy and pastespam drivel from blue check accounts certain hate speech accounts can straight up doxx users and still avade suspension because they are being protected ads are almost always complete nonsense spam scams ai generated ect wow
message keeps crashing keyboard takes ages to open when i want to type something is off since yesterday please fix it
amazing app i had to curate my timeline for the first hours but after that it is where all information is reported a day before it hits the media
getting worse everytime i tried to change my profile pics the quality is sucks worse than g video quality its just works fine with some selfies pics im using android but it works fine with my previous iphone
i was trying to log into my account but am unable it is asking for a phone number i no longer have and dont even remember so as far as im concerned my account is forever lost no way of contacting anyone and no other option to try to recover my account
if i can add a half star i would cause it doesnt even worth any star i have been trying to send messages but it isnt working i have to delete the app and download another still same thing please fix it whenever i enter any chat it doesnt even move any more
this app is in violation of tos they removed the effectiveness of the block feature i block people so stalkers arent able to view me or my content with this update those blocked people will now be able to view my account this is a huge safety issue
forced opting into training the platforms ai and soon the block button will basically be useless this app sadly is just no longer safe to use
awful stability issues media doesnt load half the time and the app stops functioning if my phone is plugged in
a shadow of what it once was so many many more bot accounts and scam adverts since the change over all the ai stuff is just dull and lifeless so many posts seem to be ai gibberish
everythings great except for the fact that i cant access my dms with someone ive talked to a lot already tried uninstalling and it still wont work
seems stable for current features but saving bookmarks needs some improvement regarding managing with names groups or folders for future reference
its been years and were still going strong on twitter and now the new x weve never had any issues on this userfriendly platform my family highly recommends x
this stupid app is crashing all the time when trying to dm people i cant open the dm tab that app will automatically crash
the videos dont play when i am connected to wifi check wifi speed and it is showing mbps faulty app
cant afford to get my check mark yet but budgeting it in the next couple weeksx has become a very important part of the free speech battle elon has saved the day again with his free speech platform and its definitely the most free and liberating platform in creation
i like the app because of the openess in terms of adult content life sucks and boring at times and x is really a great help at least dont have to be hiding under the table searching
new update completely broke the app cant send messages without the app crashing and losing my progress
since the new update this app keeps on crashing especially on andriod phones please fix it because its to annoying already cant use the app propely
very bad app the feed automatically takes me to the top while scrolling wth is this scrolled down so much and it takes me up to the st post again and again
literally the worst for android users idk why we dont get half the things apple users get like voice tweets anonymous space listening being able to copy and paste a gif and being able to start a space while private these arent even anything crazy yet we cant have it and thats just an android issue in general this app sucks and u cant even block ppl bc they still show up when u search things and they can still see ur tweets now
it kept logging me out and locked me out of twitter account for no reason all i did was retweet and give a like makeup product and fall decor makes no sense
the constant updates removing perfectly good features or changing them to be worse has been running this platform into the ground ever since elon bought it
app was good but it lags stucks anywhere logs me out anytime without any reason and then doesnt logs in back easily very sad
x is a worst app when you taken subscription highly chance to suspend x never give chance and it doesnt tells why it suspend but formly twitter was better than x because that say this videopost violence created kindly delete this
constantly freezing or just wont load up out of all my apps this one is the most finicky
sep yet another update and android x still does not support autoadvance disable noticed aug ios x does user since
useless for androids cant even optimise the app to at launch the feed without a hassle worthless im not gon na buy an iphone just for this app to actually work cause that only audiance the devs care to cater
since elon take over this app keep going down hill the latest policy update about block feature is absolutly nonsense and you should reconsider this decision again from the best app i use to the worst one ever
i dont want to see another video after i finished one video this app is not tiktok i wont be doomscrolling on this app who came up with this idea does any of you try to qa test this
from last two days nothing is showing on twitter even after downloading again and again from google play store feeling very disappointed it is slowing down again and again feeling disappointed
there are times where absolutely nothing loads edit months later the problem has just gotten worse edit the app just doesnt works when the phone is charging
x is getting really good spaces play out as a kind of live community podcast commuties are replacing the toxicity of reddit for me and they are constantly working on the live streaming and video platform really is the everything app
since leon elon taken over this it sucks i had been it logged out and now i cant even log back in i had made a new account and locked out of that one elon has drove this into the ground i do not recommend
im seriously planning to delete this app like talk about a bs app its logged me out of my account more times than i can count but what makes it worses is the idea that everytime it logs me out i have to verify my email either yall do better of give twitter back to the original person who created it
when i open x app x app showing ads continue its irritating i am not able to show interest on x app example zepto blinkit automatically playing video
videos in twitter timeline buffer a lot and whole interface experience is poor it lags a lot please do something about and improve it
communication is key it can save lives help in emergencys notifie law enforcement no system is ever perfect have am radio with extra batteries for news and information
x deserves a zero rating and id like to report it if i block someone means theyre blocked they have no right to access my tweets anymore they should not be able to view them at all this violates a users right to privacy and horrible things can happen there isnt a shortage of stalkers online report
the home page shows a lot less relevant stuff these days and theres been a huge rise in the amount of spamfake accounts on the platform really miss the good old twitter days
filled with nazis and communists just a hate filled divisive garbage app it would do the planet better to shut it down and save the energy used by people using it it has no positive traits remotely you can keep deleting my rating ill keep screen shots and put it back up
looks like they got the payment thing sorted super happy with the product grok alone is worth the couple bucks a month
no option to move it to external sd card is bs askes for way to much permissions trying to get your info deny all block all wish everyone would get a clue and drop this junk
ever since this app was bought by that despicable man bot accounts has been very rampant you can no longer see legitimate interaction to each posts and the app itself always crashes
if i could leave stars i would app is entirely ruined and the new owner wants to change the block feature which goes against tos for both play store and app store just uninstall and use bluesky i mean it
gone absolutely down the drain the moment bluesky finally gets account privating im leaving cant even use it when my phone is plugged in
very unstable logs out randomly without any reason and then gets stuck in a loop of pop up windows
an infernal hellsite dante would run from and the coming changes to the block function seem to be a clear breech of play store tcs just like cigarettes if you havent started yet dont
its getting more and more irritating by not loading anything several times a day while my internet works just fine with any other apps
exceptional news app the most realtime coverage of world events coupled with the most accurate factchecking on a platform with the highest standards of free speech available oh did i mention grok
you guys suspended my first account for no good reason and when i try to file an appeal you will say it is not suspended but its actually suspended i opened another account and you guys logged me out and told me it was an error but ive not been able to log in please fix this
the probable spam filter algorithm is so jacked that it has marked my account times this month which kills the account for days each time fix it i get youre trying to get rid of bots and actual spam but you are completely screwing regular users too
verification of you forget your user name is impossible youd think a man like elon would make it a two step if you lock yourself out instead he asks you to remember something you made years ago will never be able to log in again i guess whatever dude
this is a bad app my account gets logged out automatically every time and even after entering the correct email and password it does not login
the last several weeks i can not dm anybody in the app because when i click start a message the app crashes
literally changing how the blocking users management works making it possible for people to see what their blocker posted i believe this is illegal and breaking tos rules since now victims of stalkers are unsafe and can still stalk the victim and many more reasons
soo buggy doesnt reload of the times no update to fix extremely bad ui worst app to use ever
lets not beat around the bush elon musk is actively taking every step available to ruin twitter in every way possible advertisers have pulled out weirdly named ai has been shoved in for premium users just recently elon has made it clear that the block function will no longer work as originally intended allowing blocked users to view posts they shouldnt and reply to others replies under posts from users that they are blocked by this app needs to be delisted by google
moderation has gone down the pan and the app just straight up does not work if youre charging your phone
i do love this app i like the fact of that its uncensored and you can be yourself on it i like the fact that i can be open on it i dont like the fact that that all the people i run into seem to want me to go to another one chat site to chat which only throws up a red flag for me and makes me think they want to scam me or con me in that aint going to happen maybe somebody should warn them not to do that with people but other than that i really like this app
turned into a loud speaker for right wing propaganda all my timeline is these days its negative rage bait every follower i get is a porn bot as well the new blocking feature has made this a done deal for me im not compromising my safety because elon is mad his ex wife has blocked him
too many ads and bots they also feed their ai using the users data and use it without the user consent the block feature also didnt do much cuz i still can see thing i dont wan na
best social media option seems much more honest and open than fakebook im not big on social media but this appears to be allowing more options than one and truly embraces theory that theres sides to every story
it gets the job done better than other android social media apps but it lacks in personality as a sideeffect of the nature of x as a social plateform
more and more ads lots of issues since the takeover the bots are everywhere people with twitter premium gets more attention and most of them are bots copy pasting other peoples reply from the comment section also the future change for how block will work is breaking tos gon na make peoples abusers be able to see everything their victim is posting is very creepy and disgusting
i love the access to politics and like minded people i dont like that its called x now but i guess a billionaire can buy a company and call it whatever he wants im just a layman the content is the point and thats why i like it
recent changes violates google plays policies twitter is making a future change that removes and changes how the blocking feature works if user a blocks user b user b can still see what a posts but cant interact with posts and the point of a block feature is to prevent blocked users from interacting at all with said account this is a horrible change too because a lot of those users are victims of getting stalked and getting harassed
its amazing how much different news and information you can get from this that the mainstream media doesnt address also the community notes are awesome they really clarify misinformation
constantly buggy pictures and videos wont load pages wont refresh commentsposts will not load etc
bots hateand ads are your timeline you wanted to follow a friend or look at silly videos well too bad youre getting ads this app is terrible
direct messages are unbearably broken at the moment causing my app to crash i have the latest update on both the app as well as my phone
app has lots of bugs videos dont play tweets do not load no matter regardless of data speeds
sadly twitter or x or whatever in elon eras is the worst app ever cant refresh the timeline playback error video n many more annoying update
completely unsafe run by a maniac refuses to load most of the time and crashes constantly
shadowbanning is still a problem limiting peoples accounts for days just for following other people is also a problem the app annoyingly jumps back to the top when scrolling through certain types of pages if you will
convenient in a way that besides having fun one also gets important news updates an interesting app
i dont know what the issue is lately but i am having issues with x freezing and closing out i keep having to reinstall
has problems when charging your phone you arent alone anybody who suddenly has problems out of seemingly nowhere its because youre charging your device
i used to use this app quite a bit but it just became a different platform for different people after it was bought the interactions dont feel real anymore
the upcoming changes to the block feature breaks tos and violates user privacy its just been going downhill since the change in ownership and will soon be at rock bottom
it sucks now the adverts are all scams or grifts lower quality than ever before and the planned implementation of the new block is awful and is the closest thing to removing a block function without doing it
great app but id like to see an edit feature for text made available to all users blue tick or not
trends that make zero sense no context provided search brings up random posts instead of most viewed garbage absolutely not a news app
i have been on this app since i never had a single issue now in i cant access this app like literally this app no longer load up anymore
dms do not work can not see quoted replies on the app faulty reporting in general its a terrible app even more so now with this new blocking feature
ive always loved this app but recently it crashed when i open my interaction tab i had to reinstall it
app is a buggy mess they have removed even more useful features dont bother joining twitter anymore it just sucks we all know who is responsible for it too dude sucks
great social app not choked full of annoying ads you still have to watch out for scammers but when you report a scammer it is taken seriously and they actually do something about it true freedom of speech
is useless twitter didnt help much to get my account after cant log in in my phone the code from two factor authentication is useless they still not respon the email
the app keep auto refreshingreloading randomly no option to disable auto refreshreload so infuriating
this app x not working on tablet properly pictures videos wont load sometimes nothing works fix this elon
this app has become self aware it is a social space for people to go and shout and scream and spit vitrilolic rhetoric under the guise of catfish bot or human it provides a space to shout into the void and be heard its ok to be trolls on x its ok to hack each other and whatever else people do there you just never know who you might be dealing withor who might be listening my platform will be similar it just required that you own one identity to be on it thats it
the sounds from previous app keeps playing they have updated the app multiple times still no fix simply annoying to use
every new feature that comes out just gets worse and worse in my opinion they removed circles public likes and worst of all they want to remove the blocking feature so that people can still see your posts despite being blocked wanting to feed user posts and content to ai is just the cherry on top
im having network issue recently any media be it photos videos profile doesnt load or load too late but with vpn evrything works again
stop refreshing the screen when i dont ask you to also the amount of disturbing things recently is insane killing people dying etc
like app just do not like how pages take forever to load or do not even show just keeps the swirling blue circle forever
your ads system is the worst ive pressed i dont like this ad for a particular ad for like a thousand times and still that ad comes in my feed
they want to basically make the block function completely useless making it that the blocked person can still see your account and posts etc just not interact with it
so annoying algorithm feed never works as my interest and like so annoying never works so well worst algorithm useless algorithm even mute words doesnt work useless options worst algorithm how even people give it and stop auto scroll please start deserves why you ignore my review idiot
since elon took over twitter and turned it into x its now the best source of actual news since its no longer censored and hes empowered an army of citizen journalists to do their own research and to report on what they find and whats really happening where they live in the world so double thumbs up and stars
to anyone thinking of using twitter they are essentially removing the block function and making it nearly useless you can also no longer opt out of all your posts being trained on ai please dont use twitter
since sometime the app does not load images and buffers alot while playing videos it doesnt even load tweets leave photos and videos aside
someone very recently tried to steal my identity and made it almost impossible for me to find and make it work again it seems as if theres no one to turn to for help on x i just figured it out on my own no offense x
even after skipping a video the sound of the previous video keeps playing this happens again and again fix it
too many glitches when you uploading video if you leave to another app the video is not uploading you should wait until the end in the hashtag section i have put certain country which i want to see their popular hashtag but it shows me another country hashtags why there is too many things need to be fix but still like this
my feed doesnt refresh for hrs i can probably get on and have a usable social media for maybe a hour a day the quality of x compared to twitter is severely disappointing
love it when it works but this f app keeps logging me out due to an error this happens when i like a post follow someone and when i open the app for the first time of the day
stuttering while using random feed refresh no smooth to use etc please fix it am using galaxy a exynos with gb ram
formerly a star app the only improvement since the renaming into x is the clustering of news stories everything else is in a horrific state your followers wont read your posts as they get buried under posts from bigger accounts who has the money is heard the most new accounts are shadowbanned conspiracists and literal nazis thrive moderation is nonexistent apis are more expensive than diamonds
for the past couple weeks app just freezes and wont load anything then after a few hours it will load
the freedom of open expression is a nice change as long as you dont click on prn then your feed will be flooded but just dont press it and youll be fine
fix your stupid app it keeps loading when i tried to scroll the timeline the app also becomes super slow and lagging whenever i try to chat via dm
im telling you this thing is pissing me off dawg i use this app for more than like minutes and it lags my entire phone dawg cant even turn it off for a couple minutes horrific experience
it keeps loading or white screen waste of time it doesnt load too when your phone is charging still no fix for this
this is the most craziest app ever my account was suspended for no reason my first sign up my account was suspended till now im not able to recover it very useless annoying app
terrible managment after elon took over app itself bricks constantly and doesnt update the feed closing and reopening does nothing
there are no more barriers to cross all i have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane the vicious and the evil all the mayhem i have caused and my utter indifference toward it i have now surpassed my pain is constant and sharp and i do not hope for a better world for anyone
its nearly impossible to message anyone the app freezes and i get a not responding error please fix this
this app is complete trash now everytime i open it its a chance if it will actually load my feed yet magically if i open a web browser it loads perfectly fine
i dont mind all other updates but update about the blocking function is pissing me off i have my stalkers blocked and blocked negative stuff so it wouldnt appear on my tl whats the use of the block button if it cant work right
app is good the only problem here is that i wouldnt reccomend it to other people because this platform is like an echochamer made up of many miserable people that would very likely spread negativity might as well avoid them
even my phone complains about constant crushes it akes up to second to send a dm constantly glitching closing all by itself or not sending dms at all absolutely worst experience with app what a trash
complete waste of time even opening the app these days feed rarely refreshers video never load replies dont load app has become useless
my drafts wont show up for some reason all of a sudden theyre still there tho not deleted or anything constantly bugging too many bots bad support people getting suspended for no reason or without no reasoning and so much more
my patreon for my writing in various places entirely centers on reposting to twitter and has since google got killed i lost about of my readership then and im dreading whats going to happen now there is no consensus among my readership as to what is the next social thang most of them are also on facebook but i do not use any meta products on principle so im a bit desolate regarding the transition ive been trying out a couple other platforms but none seems lively and very few
its got better with elon at the pilots helm to a vision without limits focused purely on our interconnectivity and the ability that has to transport us to realms and possibilities that would only be thought of as science fiction merely a few years ago as we grow exponentially as a race so does our our understanding that we may have to continually divide and conquer until we reach singularity our fusion with technology is inevitable and ensures our continuation humanity hurtling onwards
does everything i need it to sometimes though id say once or twice a week it doesnt react at all and ive got ta restart phone for it to work
often cant tweeting photos or media ive updated clearing my cache reinstalled cleaning my storage but still cant tweeting media
crashes during messages and cant message with characters only with pictures video or audio
my twitter feed for some reason it doesnt load at all and the advice is to turn off vpn i dont have a vpn to start with fix your precious app elon
blocking no longer works the point of a block is to prevent a person from seeing or interacting with you and now people youve blocked can still see your account
despite numerous complaints x continually fails to stop excessive spam fake information scams and bots incessant and intrusive adverts from temu can not be blocked and have hidden links which may hide viruses and suchlike dangerous
cant login if i chose to login it doesnt matter if i enter my info manually or used saved password it takes me back to a screen asking me to sign in again
if the apps dev need starsthen provide my req bcuz ive been using xtwitter for a oryrs now but after a couplemonths ago my acc was suspended which needs an appeal so i did it but have not received any emailbox so im out of optioni need help asapdear developers if uwould be kind enough
first the thing with the likes and now the block is useless whats the point anymore if i block them its for a reason anyways plus with the glitches i swear elon doing smth wrong but just dont wan na admit it and just keep doing wrong things
this app gets worse and worse by the day more than half my feed is now ads its being ridiculous on top of all the obvious issues with the decline in moderation
oh come on lets just be honest this app has become more useless than its predecessor more ads bots and fake news from elon musk more bugs to come with every update
i got randomly logged out and when i try to log back in a message pops up saying unable to complete request so i hit ok and it closes the app
in the middle of typing or trying to open the app you get to do an arkose to unlock your app it is frustrating funniest part is it happens frequently
photos in posts are loading very slowly now the ads are getting loaded first and very fast after the latest update
everything was fine but now every few days i just get logged out and i have to login again i hope the can fix this problem because its a really annoying
can not open dm without making the app freeze and crashing out after ever since elon is handling it x is just corny and uglier bring back twitter
videos dont load for you page wont load all posts and now they are making it so blocking an account doesnt protect you from that account
premium is the best subscription i have grok is amazing it beats google hands down ad free any intelligent person can great the best newsfeed in the world to cater for their interests and prejudices outstanding app
low quality ads pictures and videos not loading up hangs when phone is charging superfluous ai features
great content needs improvement on video playback such as play next and better multitasking capabilities
ever since the app changed ownership the app quality had gone downhill the recent update is trying to remove block feature to my knowledge its illegal to do
i have autoplay video turned off to save data but ads still automatically play video this is not ok
the app seems to always go down and during specific times of the day i can never update my feed rendering it useless
i unfortunately cant give it a zero but if i could i would they removed the block featuremade it entirely useless which goes against tos its ridiculous
keeps crashing esp when you try to dm ongoing issue for months now n none of the updates correct it for long
info away of legacy mediaample of diversitythrough which greater truth is found a platform on the path to challenge change acountability of elected leaders thus enhancing democracy and public discourse very much in need in times of genocide and futile warsgovermental intend to cover upinfluence the public to go along with their kept intend to maintain a status quo ineptcriminaldiminishing not only the subjects but immoral to established international conventions thank you
the app is barely working anymore i am getting kicked of chats and the app itself multiple times now you want to introduce a feature that allows my blocklidt to still see my tweets im
my youtube video is playing well but after last update videos available on x app is not playing on my mobile these video play only sec please resolve this issue and give new update
completely unsafe to use as of current they have removed the ability to block someone and made it so blocking is completely useless
use to love twitter now my timeline is full of ads and people i dont follow oh and i also cant update my profile picture as the app refuses to do it well done musk ruined the only social media app i enjoyed
within seconds of installing the app i got a push notification containing an ad trying to get me to use the app immediately uninstalled
i have been using twitter for years recently from jun app is failing to load pics message and not even loading the home page very worst experience
expressing anyone or ourselves in a short text is great here and it can be done in few seconds with this app thank you x
ads are dumb so many ads but i guess theyll get their ive way it the other other than that it is fine
the app constantly doesnt work with it acting slow and buggy even on perfect internet connection please fix
taking off star for the unintuitive way of opening comments on a post pressing on the age of the post the option to open replies should be below picture comment with the rest of the options
removing the block feature pretty much kills this app for me theres a reason i blocked someone i dont want to interact with them neither see their post and vise versa
i created an account few days back but i changed my phone and tried logging in but its saying my phone number is incorrect which isnt true and i cant remember my username cuz there are lots of digits involved and i cant reset it with my emaili need help
app have to be logged in again and again please fix login issue every time it is not visible it is showing unable complete request
it cant seem load pictures for the past few days or ami i the only one whos having the problem please someone help its been going on for days and is frustrating me
removal of a block button and many fr features that used to be free it is against all store tos to not have a block button elon musk is the dumbest human being in their earth and shoves this all further into the dirt every update
x is so much better since musk bought it my only gripe is it still keeps pushing politics my way especially ones i dont want to see or hear from democrats please fix this
consistently lags and crashes cant send a message with a photo cant send messages fast
i love it very muchim very addicted to x reason why im not giving it a five star because i would like to see some improvements with grok which is totally better than openaiy a long shot only thing i dont like is that you can not upload personal files or images to grok but other than that x is the best social media platform period
the fact that they changed the block feature so that it doesnt stop the blocked person from viewing your posts is dangerous and may get people killed sad the leadership doesnt care about user safety
tooo worst update is there i cant open my old id when twitter become xnot either id its not opening than how i can open my idsoo please kindly kindly solved this problem then we all use like old twitter i am sure that every one has this issue
my account is hacked and later blocked by twitter i tried all efforts but unable to do so it says logout and then appeal to unblock account when logout it says to login i am fade up with your company process there is no transparency and customer care service please share your company registered address in india i wish to send legal notice as twitter dont have any legal right to block its user unnecessarily and harass
horrible video sound continues through all the other videos and keeps going on home screen
this app has become the least reliable its ever been not only are there millions of people spreading outright lies and political propaganda from both sides but the app crashes every minutes the guy who runs twitter x is a stupid name needs to keep his nose out of american politics djts butthole and pay attention to his own companies and their customers
really good app i feel safe thanks to elon audio and video calls need to improve sometimes its struggle to connect also the media section in profile needs to look like instagram style not posts
i have found the x app to be very useful for news current events socializing networking and generally everything and anything youll need in todays up beat forever changing society good job elon keep up the good work
the platform is a hotbed for s workers and people that post the most absurd political statementson both sides that are fed to the masses to mislead them im sick of patriotmaster type accounts flooding my notifications until the platform gets cleaned up this is what it gets now i think the ui is exelent it is very clear and nice to look at that is where the app shines crazy that other apps like facebook cant figure this out
i do not agree with the update of ai using art that people worked hard on literaturedrawingspaintingsphotosect to make ai learn about us wasnt elon scared of robots himself once and stopped postingworking on robots to help him mentally i stand against this change and will leave this negative comment and i hope many more do as welli hope you revoke wanting to add ai into twitter x antiai noai
panama city from panama part sees broken because old tech support was outdate due lack upgrade infrastructure challenge caused glitch system and abandoned from many countries trade without update on panama city only required foreigner samsung sound not glitch as china cant skip login
i paid for premium subscription a week ago but ive not seen any premium feature up to today its allowing me to pay again for another subscription have not been refunded what should i do
i love the app but the ads are irritating and the app usually freezes and doesnt want to refresh the timeliness
its been a great source of info as far as the app goes although you do have to fact check the info later on and a great place to connect to the thoughts of the general populace overall a good app i highly recommend
it something wrong with app sometimes lags and there like option was not working properly i think developer have to add new feature for like option
after opening the app when i try to login it closes by its own and shows error msg something is wrong please try again later has been happening since past one week
lots of glitches since last update constantly crashing if they fix it then i will give it a higher rating
i only downloaded x because i was tired of facebook showing me certain things and i needed to do my research in order to vote this november x has opened my eyes to the real world one still must not believe everything they see and perform fact checks but i appreciate this platform and barely use fb anymore
app is not at all usable for me media is not loading for some reason while rest of things are working fine fix it asap
x seems to have slowed down videos are nog being streamed fast multiple irritating long pauses during streaming
useless still cant refresh or load anything when phone is on charge unplug it and its fine fix it elon
guest checking out my options as a guest it is great we have free speech good and bad it all works if not we have the option to leave
very slow to display photos and videos on the other hand i open instagram and youtube very smoothly
im experiencing an issue when i try to use my dms the app blocks and kicks me out of the app when i try to send a message
terrible changes have been made to the application as of late even changes that violate user privacy and intellectual property of users i wouldnt recommend using this app or website
so many terrible crypto ads and the app doesnt work when phone is charging never had that issue with any other app or before elon bought it
this app freezes struggles to stay connected to the internet alot of buffering its horrible
honest undivided unbiased news with receipts from both sides of the fence personal unscripted uploads that users may choose to make unavailable anywhere x rocks the spot
definitely uncensored any random thing seems to be welcome the interests i follow are constantly updated so thats nice i dont have to go searching to get updates
new phone downloaded x cant sign in errorcant create account error i see other people are having the same issue
probably the only app out there that actually shows whats going on around the world without censorship obviously speaking in the political society sense completely recommended
i miss my rd party reader so much twitter app is a complete pos media doesnt load repeated tweets an exercise in frustration thanks leon
very unresponsive app videos take a long time to load even though i have a very stable connection
the app was working fine until a day that it wasnt loading videos i updated the app thinking it was gon na fix the problem but it didnt please attend to this issue
they are about to implement a feature where blocked accounts can still view your account just not able to interact which defeats the purpose of the block button option
its getting worse by the day no longer have a decent for you tab and its genuinely disappointing ever since elon bought it everything is going downhill
its becoming frustrating using this app responding to dms is not such a hard chore because the moment i close it the app hangs please fix the bugs
very glitchy idles alot videos dont play regularly freezes i thought this app was suppose to get better not worse
no explore settings to change explore section it is working like insta reels bring back the old explore section or i might consider uninstalling
the apps has gotten worse now i use to like twitter but nowadays with a lot of ads and bots makes the experience a lot more worse
twitter is now updating their terms of service to allow blocked individuals to still see your content if your account is public which is a major safety risk they are also claiming they have the right to distribute sell and feed your content into their ai system there is no option to opt out of this
automatically logged out even though i didnt log out every time i open the app i have to log in again twitter wasnt like this back then its disappointing
not loading content fast can be on wifi or data tried reinstalling not sure what has changed
app was great when it was twitter now every time i open the app i wonder if my feed will load or not very unreliable
absolutely amazing app i love the wide variety of creators and free speech so refreshing
i choose my username when creating a new acc but it gave me a different one it shows username could not be updated while trying to change username tried many times facing same problem how to fix this
havent been able to message a user in days without the app suddenly closing no one else i message gives this issue fix it
this app no longer allows you to block people from viewing your profile if youve ever blocked an abuser x has now given them full rights to view your profile as much as they want
so much problem i am not able see any media i thought its network problem but no its a x problem no picture no video is loading
in the x there is ga problem the posts are failed to send i tried so many times x team has to fix this problem
it keeps on logging out itself it happens like thrice a week this pisses me off so much that i couldnt give more than one hope this fix soon
became worse maybe from last year unrelated posts nudity and pathetic experience i used twitter because all influenced people on it and its keep us upto date but its become vulgar now
some technical problem i have for last one week everytime media loads very slow i think my network was slow but it doesnt please resolve this issue x team
this app is finished it used to be fun now its just a heavy mess that takes up way too much space on your phone and timeline loads too slowly elon musk ruined the fun
between the nonstop ads and graphic content that shouldve been removed by their systems i dunno how poorly this app can get dont let these star shells fool you x is getting worse by the week
i have trouble accessing the comments section on my phone its doesnt always go to them when you tap on them and i find that frustrating
went downhill event blocking isnt blocking anymore super unsafe for people who have stalkers and for womenmennb or in between with people harassing them as we can no longer even truly block our content
the app is working time out of its bugging every other day and the interface is also unpleasant to see
this app doesnt work at all if you had a twitter and want to make a new account but dont remember your old twitter information in depth youre blocked out
x is the spot where twitter died so far the same thing with a new name still the same toxic environment and not really a trusted source for news as the description implies
app has no support doesnt allow you to change profile most of the time theres at least one basic feature that doesnt work
the best app where the st century experiences are discussed and scrutinized without fear or favour one can found knowledge loughgrowinformation and take sober decisions based on the worldwide experiences
going so downhill and now with the new block options its utter garbage using it only because other options arent available to me
every day i get the same stupid issue where it just stops loading a thing and its been going on for so long without a fix absolute trash
the app turned into a joke ever since the new guy took over now minors cant even block predators and creepy old men theyll still be able to see their profile pictures videos and tweets this apps enabling pedophila and grooming yikes
its x truthfully i found twitter easier and more pleasing color scheme wise to the eye to much black with x
sending private messages takes time not real time why and it is also sent multiple times
worst now videos and images takes too much time in loading cant refresh the feed as well
nothing loads its been days stuck on the same feed the videos and pictures wont show smh
the platform has turned into a cesspool many sexcam spam accounts will follow you if your profile is public but if you leave it private you lessen your experience unfortunately this is where all the user base is spam accounts just need to be removed off the platform
after awhile my followers cant see my replies dont know why and keep changing my password until finally get back in and i get x rated spams and bots i cant tell if someone may of hacked my account i blocked a lot of people wanting me to buy sex contents and im pretty sure they are fake accounts from maybe pakistan because now im starting to get apps on play store that seem like i describe above and they say they are coming from pakistan
i used to love this app and its been ruined and become almost unusable ive met all my friends here and it makes me sick seeing this app go down this way edit its only getting worse this apple is cooked
keep on getting playback error on every video tried everything feels like it doesnt work
make likes public again the site also doesnt even load of the time i open it and its not a wifi issue wont even let me use it while charging my phone
my account is suspended for no reason and when i try to create another account it shows check your connection bit i have perfectly fine connection
my original account was suspended so i set up a new one after about years i dont want the original one and i can not get into my new account glad i hadnt upgraded yet on my new account
unable to load video smoothly after update either takes very long to start orand stops halfway
the app just keeps on saying something is wrong pleasetry again then closes when you try to log in you wont be able to login for hours or sometime a whole day
threads have organisation issues x premium needs more features to really feel premium approval for becoming a creator really takes so long it has no specific time frame its shaming premium users should be able to edit replies and posts on no time duration limit stripe is so limited that most users have to lie about there personal details on signing up for stripe you can do more
it sucks now since e get the company the app keeps crashing down cant send dms everythings monetized please fix it
the search result are becoming a worse day by day now people who blocked by me can seeing my tweet whats the point of blocking features are you insane are you having fun that now stalker bully and spammer could freely do that because blocking are useless i still keep getting ads that i said im not interested and get spammed by ads in one scroll it cant be blocked and i cant leave the comments that the company is the scum and scammer
ill be leaving this platform before it shuts down eventually you cant block people anymore breaking the tos of google play as well as apples tos this is highly annoying and harmful so ill see myself out
its harder to load some tweets sometimes also i cant get my verification text or i cant enter it says its no longer there or its an error
its fun to be on but the updates are horrendous this new update is straight up illegal removing the proper function of the block button is going to ruin this app
so many issues now it is hard to list also changing tos constantly removing the block if your account it public and how they can use your info are the two coming up next
i hated twitter so i only used it once i love x for news and its freedom of speech its much better than facebook and other social media platforms
has become the only social media app i use i have good control and dont get over flooding of random ads that dont mean anything x is the future of content creation
why the hell ad sound is on even though its sound is on mute this is one horrible bug if that was intentional to unmute the muted ad sound while feeding is shiwing an ad then this is some worst thing to happen to this app
blocking is not really blocking anymore more like putting a chainlink fence also new tos is unfair for real human artists thank elongated muskrat et al for that
x is saving the world and it must have saved many lives by now shame it wasnt there in time to counter the safe and effective debacle also democracy is pointless without free speech thank you elon
dear x from last days im facing issue in watching videos it gets stuck loading fail idk why i have a good wifi speed and i face no issues in any other social media app please fix this things
seems like more bots ai than ever also feels overwhelming negative over past year too many conspiracies ppl spewing hate almost feels like a propaganda machinei miss twitter
cant see the icon anymore from my profile that shows if an account follows me when i scroll thru my following list other than that no issues at all
last update made the worst video player experience no fast forward large text on the bottom of the video random unwanted videos most of the time video control tools are not available
lately when i go onto the app it treats me like i am new and wants me to create an accout or log in i close it down and then reopen the app and everything is fine
the new app isnt working on my device the dm session always hangs and freezes each time i open it as at recent
at least twice a day the app will not load everyday i get on i have at least bots following me nothing you can do to stop it i unfollowed elon musk and he still floods my feed and as your scrolling it will randomly bring you back to the top of the page if i could give stars i would
why not fix the problem of continuously crashing its seems to be the crashing this app is your life of goal
full of right wing garbage forced down your throat these days also glitchy as hell app is constantly crashing whenever you try and type a dm
i dont know why x didnt work like its a network error but its not evey time app dont seen a vedio or photo very bad experience
significant stability issues in the past few days and difficulty loading timeline long before that
when initially joining i enjoyed the app fast forward a year it has become so glitchy i tend not to get on it likes get removed post i repost dont post comments removed for no resson im sure x is being attacked due to the freedom of speech elon has provided us also its an election year
totally bummer app you need to download for real to access your past liked post the hell is this whats the point of this app this use to be good when it was still called twitter and not x
i am so disappointed with the fa verification even if i did activate it is still asking me a code now i cant regain access to my account worst app ever elon mask should do better not making it worst
x is good social media in regarding to politics the challenge for me is pornographic picture and video easily accessible therefore if you will develop a tool to regulate for those who dont want watch
im so glad for this app im getting news and information that the current media is withholding from us i never used twitter because it was horrible but x is just fantastic
unusable on android keeps crashing wont refresh feed was using browser now im just not using anymore
crashing more than the haitians in ohio the app constantly freezes locks up does not refresh content horrible
loads half the time if youre lucky full of bots and now steals anything you upload to train its ai amongst other awful features
keeps on failing to load the timeline comments and everything every once in a while yet other apps are okay
x is simply xceptional amazing concept faster performance and global platform
its full of interesting topics maybe more usa based though id like to see more content from different parts of the world
if you like ads then this is the perfect app for you if you like reading tweets use brave browser or some other browser with ad blockghosteryublock instead of this app
the service is becoming more and more hostile towards its users it is in a very fast decline you are doing yourself a disservice by accessing this app
they promote people spamming random unoroginal posts that were stolen from somewhere esle by paying them revenue for views when you have a check mark so what your left with is of post replies filled with spam its actually cringe how bad it is
twitterx has gone rapidly downhill since elon musk took over id go way past the character limit listing everything but some highlights the report feature may as well be nonexistent even when posts are in clear violation of policy literal naziswhite supremacists gaining a following new features rolled out seemingly every week that users did not ask for or consent to your data being used without consent to train ai you have to manually opt out and now the inability to block people
imagine having an amazing social platform with a valuable name elon has really ruined the platform now the app wont even stay open what new bug have they introduced
so many bots and porn and just stuff i dont want or care to see mixed with a slow and buggy interface twitter
since elon took over its soooo much cleaner and less crazy town the video integration and spaces are awesome its the only news app i use
if i can rate this at a zero i would my account got suspended out of nowhere and i had it since with no explanation and now they want a dollar subscription to view more posts
just downloaded the recent update now when i go to open the app it keeps shutting down before it really opens
went downhill after the elon takeover but the excessive porn racism islamophobia that is allowed in this app is insane most of the good features are gone and now that was a key feature block is useless
elon stripping the capabilities of the block function is yet another step toward ensuring the breeding of toxicity increases exponentially i would prefer to have some more controls over formatting my tweets tbh
amazing app its a force for good in the world remember they want to censor you elon on the other hand literally supports free speech by allowing everyone to stay on thats the difference
simplistic censor mechanism that doesnt understand metaphorical or indirect commentary an a appeals system that is an infinite loop to make sure you can not appeal so basically same thing as every other platform just with its own agenda
it is a very good app but the only problem i find is that it always logs me out of my account which wastes my time and stresses me out whenever i need it
great experience have not had any issues or glitchinesswhich is just absolutely unheardof
ever since the new update im not able to message anyone everytime i tap on there dms it freezes the app and wont let me type anything
i really love what has been done with old twitter now call x theres more going on better posts a lot more info like when posts info is incorrect then some selected people can put community notes and the platform feels alive more than ever
unable to change my profile picture despite several attempts i like the app but thats such a basic issue that its persuaded me to write a rare review
best the most powerful social media app ever however reducing star due to recent experience in the app it just lags so much these days
i find x to be the best place for breaking news stories often stories other media outlets either refuse to report on or they are hours late in covering it
hi i cant create new x account i have been trying for few months it is saying that something isnt right please try again later i tried alternate gmail and phone number but still doesnt work
great app even better under new ownership there are still some accounts suspended which is unfortunate i believe in total free speech terms such as hate speech misinformation disinformation malinformation are orwellian used as tools to censor free speech
its better after elon bought it out community notes is an incredibly positive influence on social media its helping prevent fabrications lies and misleading info its also hilarious seeing celebrities get fact checked left and right
everything seems to function quite well despite the criticism and low ratings i have poor wifi connection and i havent experienced any lag so far
please stop forcing your ads to play in the form of videos which makes the whole app hang all the time
i have been trying to make an account since four days and everytime i try they show and error please solve this issue as soon as possible
now ive got to upgrade later i tried and tried to upgrade but was blocked from recovering my login for a long time same with my sister she tried to contact support and cant login what do i need to do to get verified i was fine until i got a new phone i kept my phone number too and the app does not accept it i guess people get problems after getting a new phone
every time i try to make a new account i always get rejected because apparently i cant do that right now this is a bad app which doesnt work properly
application did not load the data easily always stucked every update is saying bug fixed but here major bug is loading data smoothly is problem
worst experience of a social media basic functionalities are being put to paywall bots are even worse now with blue checkmarks to amplify their presence bloated useless features nobody wants an ai companion with a stupid name like grok or twitter space hateful and discriminatory posts are amplified its cto posting disinformation garbage
changing the way that blocking works will only allow for harassment to run rampant people who have dealt with stalking and unwanted interaction will no longer feel safe here
before i even started using x my account got blocked i tried to verify my account but it would not allow it i even went as far asking x what should i do to get my account followed the instructions i even uninstalled it and install again still blocked just made me go crazy i con not entery the account i made minutes ago
x is insane features are continuously rolling out it gets better weekly the old twitter seems like a joke considering the enhancementsit certainly appears to be user focused now as opposed to shooting for
love the app only issue i really have is the fact that people get demonetized even though theyre driving advertisers to themselves so much for free speech
spam porn bots ai artists cryptobros and horrid people are what you find here and you soon wont be able to block them anymore what fun go to bluesky everyone its alot better
it hangs and does not load content i went to the browser and it works so the issue is the app not the x
changes to the moderation and blocking features by the owner has changed this social media platform into one filled with propaganda and hate content google should consider removing x from the store
cant see times on post unless clicked on i like to see the times posts are posted without having to click on every single one fix this
videos do not work unless i close the app and then reopen it but when that happens i lose the video im trying to watch
very bad experienceagain and again not sending msgs and not work properly without reason suspended and locked accountvery hesitant app
my account got suspended for no reason with no explanation and i dont even know why i appealed it and their response was x reserves the right to permanently suspend accounts that violate the x rules or terms of service without further notice this account is suspended thanks x thats pretty messed up for a user of plus years for all the inappropriate stuff that goes on on that platform and i get banned for no reason is just dumbfounded at the very least x could tell me why i was banned
the app is hardly usable riddled with ads bits and constant bugs you cant even view quote tweets anymore
pretty much unusable for a year now extremely buggy dms barely work filled with bots and the few real accounts are nothing but racist slop the removal of the block function is whats making me fully move to bluesky and tumblr
this app is quite literally rolling out a change that is a violation of the app stores tos by changing the block button so it doesnt actually block anyone anymore it needs to be reported
it is very difficult now to loginthe verification to login has only one optionthe animal sound had been removedyou can be log out with your own knowledgewhat make x today are cryptoadvocates
x is a premium social media source for news and information pick and choose what interests you communication is a twoway thing i listen to you and you listen to me freedom of expression and the right to disagree
it is helping to keep free speach alive operates smoothly not overly intrusive looks good
a much needed morph free speech is in fact free i see many things i dont agree with thats because free speech operates in this manner we filter ourselves if you dont like it roll on through everybody gets to speak period
elon has really messed up this app so much silly and useless ads whats the meaning of this if this is a way for us to purchase the premium then hell with you guys
there is a problem in the twitter android app for many months this shows tweets from hours back and then goes back to sep th tweets which i saw yesterday are missing please fix this asap
to much bugs in video play when i play a video and after play another video then i get st videos voice or sound infact when i open other page then i also get priveus video voice
this was the last good text based app and elon has completely tanked it and its virtually unusable what more needs to be said
i like twitter its nice to go with for so meny things to follow also i am having an issue now do to when i click on start message it freezes on that screen now do tonthe update
i really do love this platform its exciting to see this change occurring in real time what is also very exciting is well i didnt want to spoil it but believe me this is outstanding
what has happened to x it wont load the thread it wont accept reaction or retweet just keeps on loading going from bad to worst really irritating
would be but id like a way to markrevisit posts ive seen watch later and file these into different subject matter headings that i can find more easily not sure if this is already possible
terribly run and garbage experience suspended my account with no reason given save yourself the bother and just dont even download the entire app is filled with so much hate and since ownership shifted all of that hate is pushed to your feed do better for yourself and delete this from your life
i think as of my personal view x is the only media for freedom of speech so most powerful social media tool in the world rest all apps are just kidding and wastage of time thanks team x
for some reason there is always an error whenever i try to load videos overall this app is full of bugs and bots now
elon did it surely not perfect but we all share and occupy the same space and im happy to see that people can have voice freely no matter how simple they are sometimes
violations to privacy obviously yes this is about the new update on the block function i will stay private as for now but this app has gone downhill ever since
this is the worst app ever i try to log in to my account but can not the password always correct but can not log in to wth
probably the most toxic and hateful online space on the internet and now you cant even block people either uninstall or dont bother to install it has genuinely been designed to create conflict because its more profitable
doesnt load if youre phone is charging dms dont have notifications anymore the social environment is downright nasty and now theres intrusive autoplaying ads on every post masterful gambit sir
app takes forever to load sometimes and the app doesnt even work when the phone is plugged into a charger
unable to disable ads autoplay even after setting changes same ads keep coming even i block them
thank you but i suggest to lessen a restriction and shadowban act towards your user some of us just too fomo and tend to reply a lot of comment not intentionally for bombing or spamming but too excited to reply a lot because comment section have translate button while dm hasnt
removed functionality of the block button which will flood my feed with content i dont want to see interesting business decision for sure but i will be uninstalling due to it
slow with frequent crashes sound from previous video still plays while viewing next video
massive staff layoffs and they say its working fine the bots the spam playback error playback error playback error playback error playback error playback error on every video sigh
app has gone downhill since elon took over numerous errors riddled with literal neo nazis not to mention the block feature is disabled in a bid to max ad revenue
theres nothing much to say the best app in the world right now the only place you can express yourself without the government tieing you down x is simply the best
same as facebook basically they locked me knowing i been the same user on my phone since i got it they claim they sent the validation code that never happened
no option to disable autoadvance in video player like ios will stop using the app until its added
im not an english native speaker so please make subtitle as mandatory in xs videos so i can learn english because sometimes i cant catch up what people talk about
works well but some people can be very horrible edit for previous review was two stars but if i can rate zero i would this app is so awful now its a disgrace hope you fall elon
getting worse with every update since that man took over edit apparently the block feature is useless now the blocked users can still see your tweets but wont be able to engage which is diabolical
my first review on the app was back in now i come back in to say this app is not it ever since it got taken over by that musky guy its been seriously breaking tos what do you mean people can still see your posts even when theyre blocked what do you mean everything you post will be used for ai disappointing to see an app devolving and getting worse by the minute
im only making this review to bash on the new block system because what the hell is that why would you allow blocked people to still see your account oh they cant interact its still breaking tos and a breach of privacy it can put people in danger its bad change it
this is the only place free speech still exists you can real information and the app is fairly easy to use thank you for this app
decent experience however video features is downright horrible especially with no setting to turn off autoscroll after a video ends
x is getting worse day by day i used twitter for years never had single issuelogin page is not loading automatic my account sign out and lots of more bugs
videos tend to not know when theyre not being focused on causing overlapping noise
it got worse every update they didnt care what users wanted nor even care about human rights anymore they make user to have rights in wrongs by changing policy every post writings drawings everything in this app will be used to training without the original person needed to be consent and no need to pay license for using it at all since you choose to use our apps it means youre concent that everything post here will be ours whats this social app trying to be
youre breaking tos and violating user privacy policies if you dont change course i am fully switching to bluesky and report you to the app store
everytime i open the app it isnt refreshing nothing plays then after some time it gets working please sort it out
app doesnt work freezes constantly and wont refresh daily driving me crazy
of the time nothing loads sometimes just texts loads and images and videos wont load extremely infuriating halffunctioning app fix it
some social media apps are not as good as desktop versions but this twitter app is not like that download and stay connected
x is the best app for free speech and realistic poll reflections world events spread in seconds x users are the most informed
i love x i love the fact that people have a place to say whats on their mind without censorship but recently it kept logging me out of the app dont know why but i was ready to uninstall this app
terrible no support randomly suspended my account but when i try to contact support it says my account is not locked out so i can not file an appeal app constantly rebooting non stop now
it crashes on me rather frequently having me sign in and authenticate then tells me it cant perform certain things
i love x my only complaint is that it desperately needs a notification history its impossible to keep up with all the posts otherwise
its and the twitter app doesnt refresh the feed if the phone is charging round of applause for this feature
my internet speed is good but having trouble loading pictures and videos very frustrating experience
it keeps lagging everytime i dm someone sometimes it force close and i cant even send a picture in the dm please fix this issue
barely works since the take over regular crashes tweets never loading a complete shambles
full of spam bots from milddle east too many ads in between posts and comments all of the above really reduce the joy greatly from using this platform
can not retrieve messages at this time can not refresh activity at this time free speech unless its free speech that elmo disagrees with twitter used to be good now its a circle jerk of neonazis homophobes and transphobes x is cooked my guy it soft locks my phone when it has its reliable playback error leon could have done much better things with billion than depreciate its value spread misinformation and inflate his follower count
sometimes when i click on the app it signs me out and then wants me to login when i put my credentials to login it does not log me in sometimes if you wait for the app to log me back in so i can use it
every change made recently to this app has made it almost unusable and unsafe there is no privacy protection
whats wrong with it i have to authenticate several times a week and to do that stupid puzzles before each retweet and so on its literally one of the worst apps including reddit ive ever used
worse in every way imaginable impressive how quickly that guy nuked an app and alienated core users and advertisers alike real business genius right there had to downgrade rating once he actually got to the blame the adl portion of the self destruction handbook bonus points for eliminating block function why allow users to pick who has access to them thats not fair to malefactors
active daily user for news networking and trend engagement love realtime updates and wide reach improvements needed in content filtering follower management and spam control
thanks to elon every week theres something new that breaks now you cant even browse while charging your phone and thats without mentioning the rampant hate speech
sometimes the app is not loading and not showing amy new feed for hours i dont if it is a server break down or a bug
why is it that when an account is permanently blocked u can still access it why not just delete the account can a feature that lets u see wats trending in each country and globally be added please
a great place for accurate unbiased news and information unlike legacy media x will ultimately be the cause of death of legacy media
what about adding blockmute feature for community some community posts keep showing in my timeline all the time and dont want to see it but it keeps showing up
app becomes dead weight when charging cant refresh post or engage with anything while your phone is plugged in
went off the rails once elon got a hold of it its a good platform but just awful marketing decisions actively making the platform worse to use
dawg its so bad theyre getting rid of the block feature pretty much and theres tons of corn bots and creeps on there stay off of it im gladly getting off of it since its the social media equivalent of epstein island
constantly stuck and wont load new content very irregular and just not a solid product
this application is totally trash most of the hashtags are being used by spammers that says no one can pass this post without liking it a plateform just for spammers
our accounts are linked with phone numbers names ids we are traceable we can not say or do all in fear of being caught everything else is excellent getting caught in pakistan is no joke either
its an entertaining platform once you curate your feed more people would rejoin x once the platform starts financially compensating regular active and engaged users social credit
i liked the old logo before issues cant log in and too strict about logging in my account and im cant even log into my account what happened to x twitter i cant even make a new accountlog into my google account argh
twitter used to be okay but it wasnt terrible ever since elon took over each change has made the app incrementally worse and less usable the fact that hes now allowing people you have blocked to view all of your posts is simply ridiculous and only benefits the worst sort of users
x is a most enjoyable app it has entertainment and news outputs as do other apps the news is just different on x
poor on android no voice tweets no option to search for spaces app crashes frequently can not mute hashtags directly from the app
bad dm keeps closing search engine barely functioning qrt barely appearing like this isnt a funtioning app hello
this app works well im not giving stars because i cant cast video footage to my tv other than that x is awesome
absolute rubbish and full of bots since it became x cant imagine ill be able to stand it much longer before i close my account
horrible issues barely functions on mobile mobile has consistent issues with loading refreshing etc fix it
so bad appi have login my account after min i am not able to log in myits show that any suspicious account login i try forget forget its not given permission to enter in my accountso worse aap in play store
very slow its frustrating to use x now a days and auto refresh feature is frustrating to too
video playback is too poor it stops to load very frequently although my net speed is pretty fast
why do you ask for feedback and give an email that doesnt work it says alot about how the app is functioning seen this low quality competence in the human resource offices of a warehouse
needs a little work with the interface to become more stable and userfriendly it will happen over time
allow edit button and bring back fleets worst of it all twitter keeps stopping freezing and unresponding
elon musk has ruined this app its better to wait on a bluesky invite go to mastodon or even risk your data on that thread app then deal with whatever this child in a man suit has planned with this once well loved app it just keeps getting worst
the app is really awesome with great features but i dont understand why i get logout sometimes the app is amazing regardless
the recent updates are so unnecessary just yesterday this app said that there are gon na be changes about the blocked accounts which is that theyre gon na be able to see what we post the supposed assuring thing that was said is that they will not be able to engage but to know that blocked accounts can see what we post is still an invasion of privacy thats a big violation for a users privacy fix it dont make this app look like youre experimenting something just because
loads extremely slow media rarely loads at this point almost a useless app
weirdly every time im charging my phone the app cant seem to complete the refresh and just stays refreshing forever and never actually refresh the timeline it only happens when im charging my phone this happens even after i close the app clear cache or even restart my phone the app only refreshes after i unplug from charging why
i have a few people that i still follow because weve become pals but overall it has become a place for unchecked hate speech relentlesd temu ads and spam bots if the block feature is removed i will leave
facing delay issues while loading images and videos having proper connection but since updating facing loading issues
wow this is an amazing app easy to useall the features are accessible and i recommend each and everybody to have it so as not to miss worldwide updates
the newest block policy could be very harmful block is changing soon if your posts are set to public accounts you have blocked will be able to view them but they will not be able to engage
x app has a major bug with many broken videos appearing in my timeline users are exploiting these to boost engagement making of posts misleading and broken this severely impacts the user experience if this issue isnt fixed soon the platforms quality will continue to decline developers please address this urgently
garbage sometimes the app just wont load just the spinning symbol spinning and nothing i go to web browser and its fine update still havent fixed this problem i guess firing most of your employees doesnt help for some reason the app doesnt work around pm why fix your garbage app
initially gave this a star but in recent months its been plagued with weird bugs and issues and i just learned yesterday that it only functioned properly under vpn so is this a regional issue then cant really tell but until theres confirmation to that i have no choice but to lower the rating due to its inconvenience to use update nov still crashing daily score lowered and uninstalled
its becoming increasingly difficult to navigate through constant adverts that take up the whole screen when scrolling the same adverts reappear even when clicking on i dont like this ad the for you and following tabs seem unnecessary and overall it feels like interaction with followers is at an alltime low which surely is not the intended purpose of a social app
i like to think free speech is a human right and i find this app generally allows it a lot better than a lot of social media sites
used to be really good now theres an ad after every single video that auto plays and you cant stop it from playing lots of videos just say playback error and dont work its sad to see
used to go on twitter constantly its extremely broken as it is i cant access my drafts even if i make new ones whenever i press the drafts button im presented with a blank drafts page none of my hundreds of drafts showing ive had this draft problem for months and every update since has not addressed it not only that ive mutually blocked people and am still able to see what theyre posting please fix your app
mostly very good recently though after watching a video it automatically autoplays something thats not related and is not something from accounts i am following i dont see any place to shut that off it would be very helpful if there was a setting to shut it off or just please put it back the way it was
too annoying to bother with often for no reason the thing wants me to log in again and when i do it just gives me problems telling me i need to log in again and again clearing the app cache seems to alleviate the problem for a while on top of that spaces often wont show up if they do i get a message from my system telling me that x is using too much battery and should be put in sleep mode its too much to bother with done with it
the app doesnt perform well mostly when loading replies on scroll itll just decide to stop loading more on popular conversation topicsposts the replies are flooded with onlyfans girls advertising literal unsolicited hardcore pornography videos in some cases i just cant conduct a conversation in that environment or endorse the app i considered buying premium to improve my experience but i noticed fewer engagements on peers who had the tick than my own thats one of the selling points
im facing a problem from the couple of months no sound effect on every videos i tried from setting but not solved i hope dev team help me
way too many bots cant read comments without some rando writing somthing that is off subject sometimes the updates are real slow
why is x so slow these days i dont know if its just me but most times i open my app it doesnt load new content i even try to restart the internet connection or clear the cache but it doesnt it comes back when it wants also videos take looooong to play
there is physically way too much you might like like the homepage timeline is supposed to be filled with accounts i follow for a reason and the explore tab being full of similar topics that im interested in for a reason not for both of them to be combined together where the homepage timeline is no longer the homepage timeline i dont want to open the apps homepage timeline and be spammed with nothing but you might like idc if i want something i will look it up in the explore tab
ads are concerning has too many show that theyre spying and collecting our data from other apps open the likes are hidden circles are gone useless updates keeps on sprouting which makes this app worse everyday there will always be white women showing off their private parts but instead of fixing that the likes tab are one of the ways that we find people with the same interests as us by getting rid of it means getting rid of the chance of us connecting with people do better
very good app which is versatile allowing for keeping up to date with happenings around the world and self expression
x is pretty legit you wont be censored the app is pretty good i do wish it had videoshorts button instead of having to find a video post and scroll from there
x is breaching a safety issue by changing how the block feature works its advocating for stalkers to continue doing what they do
for the love of all that is holy please get rid of the autoscroll to next video i hate this i used to get mildly annoyed at videos being on repeat but now id give anything to have that back instead of what it does now at least make it optional in the settings there are hardly any settings to this app and its truly a shame
this app is a great way to keep up with events or personal interests when its working please fix this app far too often i open this app and nothing and i mean absolutely nothing loads profile pics dont load pics dont load new posts dont loadand it not only does this multiple times a day but its unusable for minutes at a time ive confirmed with other friends it does this for them as well the app simply needs work
im having a serious problem whereby x keep logging me out of my account without any crime please what is the issue i dont even go against community rules so why do you keep logging me out never experienced this before
i have a problem with this new update i cant login my google account because i have to type in my x username i dont always remember my x account name so please fix this issue i hate it so much please remove this option where i have to type in my x username
update may i finally updated it to x the app crashes a lot when im opening dm i updated the app again on june and the crash still happens everytime i open dm search bar is so slow and unresponsive everytime i open the app it forces me to sign upsign in then i have to force close the app via recent apps then reopen the app so im finally logged in so stupidly bad
best and unbiased social media ever i love the community note im satisfied with everything but mostly it strives to uphold truth in every corner
while watching videos first video keeps playing in the background even i stop the video it starts automatically
fast load times and getting better every day plus theyve cut the woke censorship
x is now beginning to replace facebook i hardly look at facebook anymore x is where liberty and truth can be found yes there is still bullcrap but community will expose lies or give the post context
the app is great i just wish there was a feature where you can see your deleted posts and have an opportunity to repost them edit apparently i cant change my profile picture like its been a problem even after updating
i dont recommend twitter used to be a pretty decent place but since its purchase its kind of become a hell scape of negativity everywhere
the latest updates make the app unusable because it just keeps on loading without actually going anywhere with said loading so youre just stuck in a loop multiple updates have been pushed out because i make an effort to see if i can make it work but its just still stuck every day at some point of the day wont comment on whatever features have been added to it since its twitter days but for it to actually be so bricked you cant even used it cmon
i like twitter more they changed to ridiculous name x and the color too even though i like black it just weird and doesnt fit well it sucks and too many ads also too many nsfw and arts thats generated by ai no creativity i loved this app for so long finally is time to move on to other apps and never coming back
my previous messages with people suddenly disappear through phone and the can not retrieve message at this moment notice happens so often the call feature is also problematic sometimes i cant call people pls makes it available so everyone can use it pls fix these problems i lost my messages with people and its disappointing
sometimes it just wont load tweets and images sometimes it just works after closing and reopening the app if a problem can be fixed by something like that it means it is a dumb problem nonetheless there are times where it just wont work at all even after resetting really frustrating experience
brilliant experience much better than twitter its just whats going on in the world thats hard to watch but i feel its more truthful than any other platform and doesnt try and focus your attention on one or two things like most other media love it elon when you fired almost everybody its what should happen in a few other major companies its just a shame russia have blocked all vpns because ive lost touch with a pen pal and she was just great shame
when you are constantly blocking people so you can have a feed of people you actually want to hear from only for that feed to get messed up because suddenly those people are no longer blocked stop pushing people to see what you want over what they want to see i wanted to see things that made me happy not your propaganda
sometimes the app is slow and posts dissapear as well as the issue of jumping around the timeline algorithm seems to promote american rightleaning political content in the feed despite not being in america or interested in american politics lots of misinformation and conversely information hard to find elsewhere posts on there so its hard to know what to believe though community notes are a good feature that balances this out wish the timeline bugs would be fixed
lagging so bad too much ads dm is constantly crashing when i reply messages do better
this app really doesnt let me into my dms and always closes by itself sometimes my post also fails to send this is so frustrating
x is unique in its class there is no similar works well and deliver the best content in the world
after taking away every other feature we once loved elon now plans to take away the block feature and make blocking ineffective this is stupid and nonsensical and i am not sure why he is so determined to run twitter into thr floor
elon musk did well and the app has always been great i would suggest the layout and format need a make over
the for you section used to be trending key words that were specific to topics i was interested in but now its just random full headlines that i dont care for
this app is terrible now ever since elon took over every seconds the app crashes when im typing when im on a dm for more than seconds even when im just looking at a post it freezes then either crashes or refreshes my page youd think a billionaire would be able to have all this sht fixed by now but nope just sucks that this app is so useful since everything is up to date in one space for information on things happening that youre interested in can elon just give twitter back lol
thank god for x where the real news and information is and although not perfect there is far more free speech on x vs the cucked alternative facebook youtube instagram etc
i enjoyed using it till they added the auto advance feature that you are now unable to disable ruining the experience for me not to mention youre able to disable it on ios but not android its stupid and has ruined x for me this feature is just pointless and not even optional unless if you have an iphone this brings the entire app to a thumbs down from me
ads are repetitive irrelevant annoying and unblockable most users appear to be bots or genai used mostly for news and now i cant reliably find anything newsworthy in trending elon can it st
miss the time when this app was called twitter still call it that either way takes ages to refresh my timeline up to minutes sometimes filled with conservative ads that forces me to click i dont like this ad about times before it finally disappears bots are everywhere used to be my favorite app but its just gone downhill
twitter used to be a powerhouse of social media from brands to journalism and political content niche communities and more musk is doing everything he can to ruin it because he hasnt got a clue what to do with the platform all thats left now is chinese scam advertising as every other brand has abandoned it its more toxic than ever with the push to far right wing content musk is peddling conspiracy theories and crypto almost daily forcing content to your timeline just get bluesky
since twitter has turned into x with elon musks inmovement x is now a much more peaceful app there is less hate speech lets false new its improved greatly
it works great i enjoy the variety of posts it allows for me to easily make a post and not feel worried i am posting too much i also like the suggestions i am offered of people to follow
its so much better than twotter i dont post but i use it to keep caught up about whats going on in the world main stream media doesnt provide all sides but i can see it here but lately the app starts lagging after a few minutes of use and i dont post just scrolling and it keeps lagging but this is the only free speech platform and thats how it should be in america keep doing what ya doing lag is not a big issue but its still there
app keeps getting crash frequently i get logged out itself couldnt login again fix asap
app is good overall very fast and a fun website however they are downsides for instance the app doesnt show all quote tweets and likes whereas on the website it shows all id appreciate if the same can apply to the app to the videos also take a while to download update ruined the app what a bunch of idiots by making the likes private likes were useful to find other accounts and posts that wont come on your feed and be more sociable now twitter is boring change it tf back
the new logo does not look attractive it looks as if your device has been hacked by a virus especially because the letter x gives the impression that there is something wrong with the device and also because the icon is black please go back to the previous one the bird along with the old color blue which were nice and beautiful in a nutshell i do not like new version at all you have a lot of negative reviews regarding this new version so make sure you seriously consider them
since the last update the app constantly autorefreshes which is frustrating and makes it almost unusable it never used to do this before but i got a new phone and installed the app on it and now its autorefreshing all the time i preferred it when i was able to decide when to refresh wish this was fixed
so long twitter switching to bluesky only keeping my account alive for when i need customer support from certain companies like tmobile app uninstalling in
is one place you find all kinds of people and personalities and all levels of iq so its all fun and educative and informative but then emphasis on all kinds of personalities
why cant it cast video from the app without me having to connect smart view manually etc why not have a google tv version of the app too if its supposed to be all about media terrible the only thing worse than it is rumble
unusable app every day for several months the app has decided to not load it usually is caused by opening a notification but can also be random takes up to several hours to be fixed and work properly before doing it again later on can not believe this bug hasnt been fixed an atrocious excuse for an app
my twitter application has not been working properly any post came on to my application has not been opening even it is for the notifications that just came before few seconds if i try to open any post it says the post has been deleted earlier the application was good but i couldnt feel the same
this app is one of the most defective apps ive used in a long while i cant open another account with the same email i cant deactivate account without changing mail its rules are not straight forward and people get restricted without a proper stated reason its response time is extremely slow
i dont know whether any recent update broke it or something but i havent been able to access my analytics dashboard from the mobile application since the last few days whenever i try to it just goes into an infinite redirectloop till the rate limit is exceeded
terrible app about half of my posts replies only with attached images get stuck in the drafts area for no good reason i end up having to resend them one time i tried sending one reply over and over and it never got posted im on good stable wifi so internet connection shouldnt have been a problem
updated from star x still isnt perfect but it has significantly improved over the past years the censorship is far less and community notes isnt perfect but its the best notation system of any social media i was never a fan of twitter finding it mostly boring but once you filter out the of ads and reposters your feed can become very engaging and you can stay uptodate on any type of news you want even if the msm doesnt want you to have the news
this app became literally unusable on android over the last months takes forever to load i have to be constantly closing and reopening the app for it to actually load literally doesnt work while charging and now it crashes when i try to go on my bookmarks on top of that it looks ugly after the failed rebrand
i get an error message can not retrieve messages at this time please try again later the app is very inconsistent update i believe this only happens when my phone is charging andor the battery is low i have a pixel pro this is the only app i have this issue with
genuinely imprsssive how bad the app has gotten since the buyout not even content wise which is bad enough but for me consistently every night between pm and like am if i try to use it itll just break for minutes and not load anything yet the website in browser works as fine as it normally does update over time this has gotten worse where its almost like rolling app blackouts and data usage from the app has increased drematically
this app is slowly heading to useless one nothing works perfectly like before especially the video it can take you over minutes to watch a video of minutes no matter how fast is your internet connection the video will stuck and you have to wait and most of the time it doesnt play at all itll just say play back error videos plays next video automatically and no settings for it
was slowly reducing time on app due to recent changes that detract from user experience but reluctant to delete app based on years of real time news and information availability currently when i do try to use it get spinning wheel and nothing loads compatible device running current app version app has successfully reduced my time spent on xtwitter to near zero
since elons purchase of this app and subsequent firing of much of the workforce x is basically unusable more often than not nothing will load thats just how it is now at first it was a couple times a night but now it doesnt work more often than it does was easily my most used app and now i dont even have the option way to go
good app bit lately i seem to almost always get a playback error when wanting to see a video also every so and then it gets stuck in loading for ever wont even fix if i close the app and open it again only fixes itself after i gave up forgot about it and open it again hours later
their is some crazy bug where late at night the app will not load anything you literally have to have your phone plugged to charge with the app opened unplug your phone close the app and reopen and then everything loads perfectly fine which is absolutely ridiculous ive had this issue for months and just found a workaround
i love that the algorithm allows me to choose the content i want to see making excellent relevant suggestions of things that i might want to see there is a real time chronological feed and a preferred content feed search options allow me to find what i am curious about without forcing irrelevant narratives content blocking hostile accounts offensive ads gives me control of my experience on x
the app is interesting and meets my requirements i do enjoy it the developer needs to work more and increasing privacy settings i want an option to follow some users without anyone else being able to see who i follow or like any content privately if i want to
why did the for you tab trend list suddenly disappear bring it back immediately why my homefeed keep showing the time and date as jan seriously fix it ffs why does the video page swipe up after it finished playing to another videopost plus the app keep auto refreshing after a while which is very annoying fix it asap stop making unnecessary changes and tone down the ads get rid of the for you tab and view counts now when are you going to fix it ffs
this is not the most trusted app you can use i wanted to download an archive of my account so of course id need to input password i wanted to change my current one so of course i reseted it i st put the password on my literal notes app so i have a backup plan and its organized i tried to download an archive again with my fresh password it displayed wrong password logged me out of my account my information were accurate especially the email ill never download this again
app built only for hyper consunerism ruining the quality of the experience the extremely and i mean extremely limited possible output of text and video are ridiculous wholly unfit for the topics its users most often communicate about feeding users original content to ai without proper notice janky feeds and terrible content regulation and search are the most notable features of x shittiest rebranding choice of the millennium the feeds also annoying logging on it sends you to the top
this app stops loading contentnew posts after some time of usage and only works with ny us region vpn enabled no other regions works such as using it outside us is even remotely convinient all that despite having premium i reccomend to not subscribe to the service as there is no support or improvement over more than a year no such problems on desktop with the same internet connection go figure definitely fault of mobile app devs
this still stands every day i wonder if it will load or not not today come on elon i thought you were the best why doesnt your app work pictures and videos dont load when videos do load they lag or the video freezes and theres soundvice versa i thought elon was smart every other social media platforms dont have these issues yet twitter hasnt stopped since that guy took over
its an amazing social media app you can tweet you thoughts and ideas with everyone i use this app because of its valuable content which other app doesnt have but one problem my faces is that it doesnt have an option to add poll with photo please add an option of poll with photo
x is a nice app but sometimes it hangs like theres a glitch when opening the app and scrolling through it suddenly stops working and force close in my device tecno pop f maybe my phone memory is low but ill love to have a lite version of x that will be so good please developers i need lite version of this app thanks
the app itself is fine about twice a day there will be times where the app doesnt load a new feed for a couple of times cant look at new tweets load images or like tweets until it refreshes automatically edit months later its getting worse and it doesnt load at all
this app constantly breaks sometimes it doesnt load anything at all or if it does it takes reallife minutes to load a single image regardless of connection strength i have also started seeing up to ads in a row before i see a new tweet which is almost never from people im actually following it is also an issue that the app automatically plays a new video when the one youre watching finishes its honestly ridiculous
this applications rating has gotten worse since it changed to x i think the internet connection is bad because this application is very slow especially when loading images but it plays youtube videos without problems it turns out that many people have experienced the same thing with problematic applications
this app is really annoying my network is pretty good but when i open the twitter its always loading over and over and over again mostly it happens at night and its been a few months for me like really with all of these updates that you released often you still can not fix this bugs
there has been an issue where i cant change my profile picture for months if i want to change my profile picture i have to go onto the website and sometimes even after i change my profile picture it drops the quality of the photo so bad that it would be better to just not have one at all i dont know what you guys did but this is the worst most irritating app to use for this reason specifically and im extremely unimpressed that it is still an issue even after so long
used the app for minutes already identified a fatal flaw the app will refresh the feed everytime you open an image or click on a post when you go back it will refresh the feed what a useless feature who thinks thats a good idea just let us go down the feed and refresh it on our own
profiles and users which i never interact with continue to receive priority over profiles i actually follow unless i block accounts i will see posts from popular accounts which i dont care about poor advertising algorithms occasionally i open the app and see an interesting post but the app auto updates the stream its difficult to find the original interesting post once again
this is an app that challenged your five senses plus your extra sensory perceptions very toxic platform full of characters that only go one way or another there are no two ways about it it is still twitter because we all twitted everything we are reading liking disliking etc one half star
its limited in certain aspects but the fact that its an open forum versus a closed fisted rule as other social media platforms inspired me to make the switch what limitations mostly the character count the number of characters or words you have available although it does help me be more succinct as its been said never miss a chance to shut up
whenever i open the x app after a while i face some problem like when i log in it gets logged out automatically for a few moments and then no matter how many times i try to log in it doesnt happen but with great difficulty and while using x app many times the automatic app gets activated but it does not start no matter how many times you try please fix the problem
get progressively worse each week old twitter never had this number of issues my content will not load i get playback errors on videos and the botsspam are out of control the app seemingly picks and chooses whenever it decides to work nowadays which can take hours for it to decide to load more than five posts
since the new takeover there has been nothing but problems there is more porn and spambots on this app its ridiculous ive had problems loading into my account hard tim filing reports due to a problem on their end ive had to uninstall and reinstall i dont know how many times this app is getting worse every time
with the latest update you cant block obvious spam ads that arent even inapp links they send you out of the app without any warning prompt if you accidentally click it autoplaying audio on ads so its like a jumpscare as your scrolling and even though i have temu blocked i still get spammed by their ads bots literally everywhere and no customer support accounts to tag anymore this is starting to feel like a virusriddled website that is just begging to get you hacked into
your x app doesnt work for hours most of the daynight it can be a few minutes to hours cleared cacherestartedstill doesnt work until the app itself decides to work my highspeed internet works great and i use all my other apps just fine please fix your app its frustrating now for the last months why do you not address these issues everyone is complaining about you dont even respond
horrible i tried to find my old search history because my friend asked something that was on my old search history before i deleted it but the code didnt send to my email so i checked everything and asked to resend it but it didnt i kept trying and trying until it said i have exceeded the number of times i could resend it even though its not my fault and every time i play a video it laggs so much that i have to close the app
its now a terrible place full of bots fraudsters betting adverts every tweets irrelevant tweets conspiracy and vile hate speech nothing works well the app wont load and when it does it constantly glitches summary it has been destroyed twitter has been destroyed even if you update it is still non functional shocking user experience moving to mastadon and bluesky
horrendous app that gets worse with each successive update the poor underqualified skeleton crew over there has removed function after function and core components work worse video loads in low res or not all at constant freezes or slowness failure to register notifications group dms sometimes show a max of the last five minutes search is a complete notstarter battery draining through the roof this is to say nothing of locking down the api or the companys moral failures of course
i have nothing but issues on this dogshit app on my galaxy s constantly no matter on wifi or mobile data the app will just refuse to load any new information i can force stop the app on the phone and relaunch on all forms of connecting to internet and nothing works i can go straight to mobile browser and x works fine this app is a complete joke
i like the app for the most part my only issue is that im not entirely accustomed to how everything is layed out and functions things could be familiarized a bit more from both sides also a youtube and youtube music like function incorporated into different sections of the x app would be awesome youtube music especially im nearly always jamming work play relaxation so a setup like that would keep me in contact with what i like people found this helpful
i have been experiencing a significant issue with the x app for the past to weeks specifically photos and videos do not load properly whether i am using mobile data or wifi this has been a persistent problem and it greatly affects my experience with the app i hope this issue can be resolved soon
it works fine normally but recently i have been facing the issue of loading i pressed the play button yet the video doesnt play its simply stuck at first i had net problems so i thought that must be the reason but now i see that despite having a good connection the tweets are not being played i wonder whats the issue
each update makes the app worse ui interface gradually becomes more unfriendly there are dubious moves on your side eg my account was labelledrestricted for what no idea if there are any problemscomplaints or so you should inform precisely there are too many paid options at the moment there is no a real alternative to x or rather extwitter but i will not recommend it any more
i love the appwhen it works times out of ill open the app and it only loads or tweetsthen it stopscant search or anything i have to constantly close the app and reopen to see any new tweets for about seconds then it goes down again and quits refreshing elonmusk your app is being throttled or somethingit hasnt worked right for months and months now
im leaving this app a one star as there is a very frustrating issue with the x app for android when you reply to your own tweet to create a thread the reply gets stuck at the top of your profile other people do not see this but it is very frustrating for the use please fix ios does not have this issue samsung galaxy s ultra user
gone hugely downhill since the change to x the algorithm has slowly been made so its just a cesspool of rightwing politicsbots repeating the same nonsense every big post having multiple of ads in the replies plus you cant even tell the difference between a verified source when it comes to news or a year old who has got mom dad to pay for a blue tick since the monetization was introduced shame as it used to be a solid app plus they are clearly paying for fake reviews atm
i really like this app but i cant do anything with it most of the time and end up just going on instagram instead the app will do this thing multiple times a day where my feed and everything on my page is not able to be seen or interacted with as if the servers were down this happens for almost hours at a time sucks not just an issue for my phone or anything since my friend has brought it up as well
since the rebranding and renaming this app has fallen so far it works maybe of the time the rest of the time it cant refresh load messages notifications or even tweets ya know its core function let this platform go guys its a shell of a shell of its former self
this app has declined in such a drastic way not just the quality of the interactions online the proliferation of bots and fake accounts but also the reliability and behavior of the app users are consistently bombarded with low quality ads the app closes unexpectedly and videos dont play as expected disappointing
after watching a video on the app a queue of unrelated videos begins to autoplay this is a very unwelcome change from the previous app behavior as it had been for years and there is no way to disable it i dont want to watch random unrelated videos when im reading a tweet if i did i would download tiktok instead
x doesnt support free speech kenyan hashtags highlighting corruption and poor service delivery in kenya are constantly shadow banned and muted the app is also full of bugs my feed keeps refreshing itself even when im still reading a post multiple videos play audios at the same time even when ive opened a specific video for some reason my videos just pause themselves and why does the video go to the next without me triggering anything the ux needs to be improved
its new to me however i know who i like to follow from other apps and so thats where i began here with a few of them until i learn x so little by little im exploring more and so far i like this platform im very new to this platform so im definitely cautiously stepping into it also i enjoy a place to hear speech and the opportunity to leave an area if i choose to do so
this application is very bad for android users updates and good features always come to the iphone first and are delayed for android and it may never reach us the opposite happens with updates and bad features in addition they do not fix the problems on android until after months unlike iphone users still bad after years nothing change
x has become so much worse than it was giving accounts with a blue checkmark reply priority was a mistake the whole place has become fake accounts replying to each other with meaningless content just to get follows i think i use it like times less than what i used to i can still be useful to look for news sometimes
stars is me being generous my account will be broken for hours at a time meaning i cant scroll interact with any tweets check notifications or reply to mutualsdms theres no sign itll happen either and the length of time i can not use my account varies its not suspension or anything like that its just part of the many problems the app has gained since last year
nothing ever loads im lucky if i can refresh my time lin even twice a day just non stop loading no pictures or videos cant interact with anyone elses posts cant see notifications because its just endless loading and trying to refresh its literally unusable at this point never had this issue in the past i wonder what happened and who ruined it
idk how to best explain how quickly this app fell off after it feels every update will be its last because even with fat speeds i get constant buffering and sometimes things wont load until or even mins passed this is probably the result of firing half the people keeping the app stable
the app is now sluggish and full of ads that automatically play and slow down the app massively you can not opt out of them either like you could before and it makes it unbearable to use honestly just using it in the browser is a better plan than this
this app is the worst my email is connected to an account but i dont remember the username or the password making it impossible to log in please fix this and ill change my review needs a lot of work the help center isnt helping because it says email and password or email and username but i only have my email theres no way to remove your email from your account either without being logged on please fix this
on my iphone this app looked great but now that i switched to android samsung z flip it looks awful everything is pushed to the right with a big space on the left but even too much space is on both sides please widen the div to take up of this already skinny screen its killing the user experience arrghh
please remove or atleast have a option in the settings concerning to the automatic refreshing of feed when exiting the appremoving the app from recent apps this is a feature from a previous version its just a hassle when accidentally exiting the app and then the article or post youve been readingwatching is gone when you open the app again
x formally twitter has porn x is now auto advancing videos which is basically when a video player once it automatically plays the next suggested video automatically which isnt what i want as i might want to watch the video two or three times before i switched to to the next video please quit inventing my videos to the next suggested video which may or may not have a relevance to the video im watching
the app cant be used at certain hours recently it keeps loading i have tried restarting my phone internet connection but it doesnt work even if the other apps work just fine which means the issue is actually with the x itself it really becomes frustrating to use
the algorithm of the application is terrible for me despite stating that im not interested in the topics it continues to spam them massively for some reason it was filled with things that dont interest me ive tried to silence and block everything related to this things including following accounts i follow again but nothing change i thought creating another account would solve the problem but it just spams more content that doesnt interest pls help
the lagging on this app is quite frustrating it doesnt let me scroll down or up and at some point it just closes and takes me back to the home screen i always have to clear app cache before it starts working again really hope it gets fixed
for some unknown reason every single post is not showing up the posts previously already shows up before the problem that im encountering now multiple attempts of restarting my phone the app itself or cleaning the ram or storage nothing shows up still i get errors that are supposed to happen when theres connection problems theres no problem with wifi connection whats the problem now is it my phone or is it the app itself please fix this problem thank you
nothing loads and i am getting constant playback errors on media i cant update my profile picture through the app anymore im getting so many ads in my feed im not seeing actual posts at this point my recommendation would be to use it on a web browser or dont use it at all
i have a strange problem with x i dont know if any of you have had it if i connect the charger to my phone and then open the x app it gets stuck whether at home or in the car that is the post is opened but if i go to any post it gets stuck and doesnt open i cant see the comments or any picture or video in the same post and i cant even interact with it whether its a repost like or even a comment if i disconnect the charger it sits for a while and then the app star
worse and worse everyday loading issues works when it wants videos always looking worse after posting taking away like views as to help in security come on now also the ads have been absolutely ridiculous and have nothing to do with my interests blocking them and if i dont like an ad it shows up over and over and i have to say dont like ad x says will show fewer and show more terrible since the change and been on here for almost years
dear x i like the app but it has these annoying glitches i think number is that when i press the continue with google button to log in it keeps saying something went wrong please try again that has been going on for weeks and i havent been able to get in number the user name is seriously annoying when trying to log in why cant you just put your password or phone number or email without then having to confirm username because i now cant get into my account since without username
absolutely garbage app gotten worse over time keeps signing me out due to suspicious activitythe only thing ive been doing that appears to trigger this problem is liking posts like i normally do i dont see other social media apps like instagram or reddit giving me these kinds of bs problems i will consider leaving this app asap keeps giving me problems and it isnt improving any time soon as long as its being maintained by a bunch of neanderthals smh
the reason im giving it star is few mins before i downloaded it and open trying to create an account in x twitter and the message pops up something worng try again later i try many times but it pops up i dont know why i checked my internet connection it works fine i try run other app and they works fine but why x twitter is not working im really disappointed with this issue and i waisted my time bad experience from the beginning
id give this negative stars if it let me app regularly breaks for hours at a time daily with can not retrieve messages at this time please try again later force stopping the app clearing cache doesnt fix rebooting phone doesnt fix id hate to be in a life death situation where i needed to get through to someone honestly thats just the tip of the iceberg regarding issues since took over
temu and evony ads that play unmuted even if i go back to my home screen even against my settings to not autoplay videos if youre thinking about downloading this app turn back at the very least use a browser where you have the final say on ads ruining your experience with content blockers
its a dumpsterfire lately the amount of unrelated ads bots and the for you timeline recommending nothing remotely related to anything you do is something it needs to be worked on and fa only for a useless subscription is a baffling move the ads that are shown are mostly scams and they even repeat it even if you choose the unlike option for those ads
im remaking my review because i rated this star a year ago and its only gotten worse since i can only go a max of posts before getting ads in a row company accounts ive blocked are specifically unblocked by x just to show me ads the for you feed is worthless just a bunch of trending content that it decides to show you for no apparent reason and now im getting unblockable ads that will play audio automatically the most i can do is mark not interested which seems to do nothing
dropped to two stars latest update plays audio from ads as you scroll even when audio from posts is muted no settings to turn this off and turning off audio on one ad does not save when scrolling to the next ad with audio the team really messed up the user experience with this
ads for every posts and if you want to watch a video another ad definition of it can always be worse anything you remember from the old twitter forget it x does everything worse the appsite lags and is unresponsive regularly why pay for adfree when it hardly works
the spaces are barely functional i have to restart my phone andor reinstall the app to get them to work half the time also i get randomly kicked to the beginning of my feed when im scrolling sometimes oh yeah and if you dont want to give twitter your phone number good luck because theyll lock your account for no reason and hold it hostage until you give them a number and you cant delete your acct if they do this i still get emails in my inbox over an acct i cant access please fix
been trying to validate my phone number for the past months it always fails i have tried different numbers in that time none work customer support is non existent and you cant speak to a real person for help i want to become a verified user and im willing to pay a subscription but i cant without a validadted phone number how crazy that the apps that broken a paying customer cant even buy your product
still lacking the right ingredients so spice it up to meet human consumption regular x handlers deserve to have at least an edit button and extra text numbers to express themselves well x is an apps for expressing the thoughts in the mind i believe no one should be gagged or be limited in expressing whats on their mind
its been progressively getting more unstable now the app will start but not load data for hours in some cases more than a day it used to be extremely stable and reliable but now its slow and pretty much unusable zero stars is not an option unfortunately so i gave
so slow on wifi it doesnt show photos at all even tho when using other non android phones i dont experience this problem with the same wifi but on mobile data it works perfectly but this doesnt forgive the big problem of being too slow and unusable on wifi
literally the only reason anyone still uses this app is because no one other place lets us connect the way twitter diddoes but every day x makes it harder and harder to stay on it i can not load up anything half of the time waiting for a response from the app there are so many new tabs i care nothing for most of my feed is now pages i have never seen or followed and i will never give in to pay to play the app forces on us or straight ads in a row oh well keep scrolling
direct messages keeps crashing i wanted to use help center but i couldnt find a related short cut and for some reason i couldnt report other issues than what they allow you to report its not a new crash it has been happening for months now please fix it
for a full year now for of the time when i try to dm any friend or send them a tweet the app closes on itself really sick and tired of this nothing worse than writing a full paragraph to a friend and the app glitches and closes deleting the whole paragraph this happens every single day i am so sick and tired of this
the app likes to randomly reshuffle your tweets while youre reading them which is very annoying coolest part tho is that it breaks about twice a day and you just kinda got ta wait the couple of hours it takes to randomly start working again aces absolutely stellar app owned by the genius behnind the tesla and spacex brands godspeed elon may you blast off into an early grave
best app out there for news however if youre paying for premium you expect the basics to work timeline is slow no notification even though switched on app is full on porn bot followers and replies alot of work needs doing to many inactive fake accounts but all they care about are the numbers
the app had been useless for months i can only be used at certain special times a day or night the app doesnt load ive tried everything install uninstall clearing cache nothing media is blank pages dont load inbox unreachable post unlikable or repostsable i barely even try using it anymore
other moderation changes aside its very buggy videos frequently display playback error images fail to load until force closing and reopening refreshing your page often shows a string of posts youve just browsed ive also started to groups of ads in a row which is excessive
this has gone from my favorite social media app to barely useable trash it now bends over to horrific ideals and is the most biased app that is supposedly free speech not to mention the latest is full screen video ads every seconds on your timeline that autoplay at fill volume
very often when i load up the app it just doesnt load the timeline at all and is just stuck on the previous days tweets it will be like this for hours then will finally work but will do it again a few hours later pretty annoying constant pornography under every tweet racists rife absolute hellhole of an app
the app simply crashes and does not refresh the page same thing with the profile and everything in it it lasts a long time and when it returns to normal i know it will happen again the photos disappear nothing loads and everything stays still for a long time this happens frequently
no matter what i do over the past few months it will take over a minute to load just a few seconds of video this app seems to be worse every time i open it how hard is it to pay people to not revert back to the s with video speed also the amount of hate speech on here increases every day this app is getting trashy
the app is becoming almost unusable is full of glitches and theres so many ads that the time line full on stop working at times how did they even manage to get an already functional good and famous app and totally ruined it im really beond words with how annoying it is to use this app this past few months the glitches are really getting to me
my x experience started off reasonably well but now its constantly locking me out of my account demanding that i prove im not a robot with an idiotic test every few days or weeks how many times do you have to prove that and now its complete garbage the app is telling me we have noticed unusual activity on your account without telling me what it is i cant log in it keeps telling me wrong password which is incorrect i know its the correct password the app has crashed
started pushing notifications about random shitposts i wasnt even following the users and the tweets were completely irrelevant and it pushed fing push notifications
in the years ive used it my enjoyment has very much plummeted certain small but important features are always finicky at best like when you untag someone when reply to a reblog and it retags them to huge features like the notification tab crashing the app entirely or not being able to scroll through tweets from people i have notifs on for or the timeline constantly jumping i mightve met some nice friends and people but i wouldnt say thanks to this app simply cus everyone is on it
there is one video of a second duration which appears constantly in the feed and there is another video of same length that turns grainy and then green its been quite some time since many ppl are facing this issue but nothings being done
this apps become a nightmare you get to look at post then ads back to back then it refreshes the timeline so you have to go back to looking at even more of the exact same adverts then theres the autoplay thats just there for no reason with no way to turn the annoying thing off not that it matters anyway cause the videos outright refuse to play anymore might as well go back in time for a usable twitter
the app no longer functions on even a basic level will work for minutes and then be stuck loading for hours if the only way to fix this is to pay for premium then i wont because i cant financially support an app that doesnt work and that has as much unchecked hate speech on it in order to even browse twitter i need to do so on desktop as the mobile app is completely broken
app keeps crashing even after i cleared cache i tried uninstalling and reinstalling it still keeps crashing messages wont load it keeps giving me cant load errors previous messages on dms and gdms keep disappearing snooze button option from the notifs isnt working i have to open the gdm for it to work x is a worse version of twitter
updated review now the sound on ads issue fixed but still keep getting video playback error and tried reporting to x support on twitter who just say we cant help you have to use feedback whats the point of having x support on there then video issue normally clears just closing app and reopen but doesnt always work and then clear cache within device for x app not great experience
every time i try to log in i get a message saying something is not right try your request later i can log in to my x account on the browser on my phone and on my laptop just fine please get the app working and keep the app working why would i pay for a subscription for x when the app is broken and doesnt work half of the time thanks for blocking me because you think theres a suspicious login when it is me trying login to my account and get a message saying something is not right
my biggest issue is that there should be a way to get back to home or the bottom navigation bar other than hitting the inapp back button when you are six levels deep in a search also unavailable in other functions as well maybe more for the platform than the app but monetizing was not the best way to stop bots the bots still annoy paid users as well meanwhile wordpress which is free has means to eliminate most bots from commenting just say you want to minutes and stop blaming bots
ads are at a point where im questioning if rent is due the notification system fails often they keep changing the ui to make it less useable huge bot problem that has never once felt like it was letting up thinks cis is a slur for some inexplicable reason total mess
update twitterx needs to be updated i get that its a free speech platform ordeal but i shouldnt have to re sign thousands of times and not be log in thru the app cell phone app needs a update considering they dont update anything i also dont like that when you are looking at something and then it scrolls right back to the top it should work for everyone x needs to update
absolutely horrible experience i can no longer go through the timeline without it refreshing randomly not to mention not being able to see the likes of other users these have been the most horrible changes to this app aside from it changing its name into something stupid along with its stupid logo
loading is completely broken videos dont play just get playback error pictures and replies wont load no matter if im on wifi or g or switch from one to another refresh the app nothing just several minute long loading screens this app was a billion times better before the biggest imbecile to ever walk the planet decided to buy it and ruin it
i just opened the app up again today and i got a message saying that my account is block or whatever so now i cant use the account i cant verify or even deactivate it because i need a password but i dont remember it because i hardly use the app so i try to add a phone number or something to change it and that wont work so im literally just stuck with the one account i tried even creating a new account and it wouldnt work i even tried the website to submit a form and nothing
ever since the app changed the constant pending of loading for hours and not updating the feed as if there is a constant bug with the app used to be a brilliant app to go on and catch up for all events and now your waiting to play catch up woth everything thats already been and happend poor value for experience the app devalued massively
the ux is too bad to consider as social media app over the months got irrelevant ads even though i choose to not interested the ads every time the app consume more and more cache for only scrolling so it needs to kill the app and reopen it only to load the imagevideos you want to watch
by every single update we expect improvements but in this case the only improvement is increase in loading time the app takes its own sweet time to load posts images videos sometimes it gets stuck and even after closing and reopening the issue prevails not a smooth working app
for you page went from being cute art to just depressing posts and controversydrama spent weeks trying to fix it by only liking cute things and using not interested on anything i didnt like but it hasnt shifted and i cant enjoy being subjected to awful content when i just want to see nice artwork and funny memes i may return in the future but for now the experience is miserable
x decides randomly to just shut me out while im chatting in a gc repeatedly i have to start the app again and again to just be able to hold a conversation there after ive typed a few words the app slows down making it difficult to type as the words show up minutes later
only problem is the password system for some reason whenever i want to change the email i use for a certain account it requires me to re enter my password but when i do so its always wrong i kept rechanging my password but i just gave up in the end after realizing no matter how many times i change my password it will always be wrong please fix this
the app has turn really bad this last few months now constant loading without any explanation even though my wifi cellular connection is fine and other apps also work perfectly fine quote tweet doesnt work everytime rampant number of ads and generally just not running that well disappointed by just how low this app has fallen
hes literally killed twitter i get annoyingly ads times in a row i dont mind an ad every now and again but this is just ridiculous and they are the worst ads ever funeral services or fake games its just weird and now none of the videos work as its just consistent playback error just insane
for me every night around to am cant seem to get on or the app doesnt load pictures dont come up you cant see any videos everything doesnt start working back again until like or am the next day now doesnt seem to matter what time it is it just doesnt like now its in the morning and in the app is not loading you cant see whats going on on my for you page its just running super slow and its not my internet connection im using wifi
theres no customer support at all if you ever have a problem and you need help too hecking bad i feel like having support you can talk to is the bare minimum for a company and x has decided it doesnt care about your problems ive been having a glitch where my quote posts keep disappearing so none of my friends can see them i cant find a menu to add new topics to my for you page and theres no one who can help
experience has been fabulous i enjoy being able to seefollow only what interests me without having what i dont want to see shoved down my throat every or minutes minimal ads make this a very enjoyable app being able to view videos thru youtube listen to podcasts etc is made simple and direct being able to voice my opinion without fear of censorship is a giant leap in freedom of speech as long as elon musk runs this app i will use it thank you mr musk and your entire team at x
its a real good app i can stay up to date with current events happening and contrast with other news sources id have to say the updates to spacex are the best though ive made friends all over the world and gave hundreds of followers already and not even been in the app service a month yet i like it nothing is perfect though i can say i definitely me using x more than i liked twitter
unfortunately i have to rate this app star because it has been constantly crashing from the past few months despite new update the issue is not resolving whenever i open the scroll down and after some time i automatically reach at the top of the feed no photos or videos is showing in any of the tweet please help me team x
the blocking system doesnt work sufficiently you can still sometimes see content from people you have blocked if someone else reposts them the muting system is insufficient as well words you mute will not always work and can show up anyways the recent removal of public likes is doubly disappointing as it removes the one thing the platform had over others it would be better to at least make displaying likes optional or something you could toggle
the app constantly freezes to the point where my timeline just straight up does not want to load and good luck getting it to play any media twitter used to be such a good app but ever since it changed leadership it has actively gotten worse and worse
selected targeting of hindus by them recently blocked me and then asked me to appeal for restarting my accountwell i did appeal and they will remember it anyways uninstalled because you can say its a communist application and suitable for their agenda only
ever since musk took over the app runs slow most of the time and doesnt even load properly when st open it the majority of the time if youve never used it before i wouldnt even bother downloading it if you do manage to load it and it runs ok its become a cesspool of abhorrent human beings
twitter is a great platform and i wanted to give it stars however ive faced an issue where i was charged twice for sms but my mobile number was not verified the developer and support team need to fix this problem issues like this shouldnt happen on such a reputed platform if this problem gets resolved the app definitely deserves stars
love x made a twitter page long ago and but never used it until i came back for the fact that elon musk made free speech a high priority and i came back and love it more than any other app now
very bad experience wanted to remove a follower but couldnt so had to block wan na remove my profile picture but cant see the option for that as well elon musk stop ruining basic things stick to your tesla and fraud space very bad experience again im encountering adult memes n videos everytime i scroll even after reporting several times they keep popping up this elon guy
in just an hour of scrolling and liking posts i got blocked twice each time i had to go through a verification process first they sent an email verification code and then i had to identify pictures with specific features like arrows pointing a certain direction seriously deleted
muted words shown despite being muted pictures of horribly destroyed corpses even kids shown on for you despite having turned off the possibility to be shown sensitive pictures truly a horrible place not to mention ive never shown interest in seeing corpses blocked multiple accounts that post these pictures always mark them as not interested and to show me less of that how is that even possible despite the settings set to no mature content no sensitive content etc
unimaginable feeling of being connected in a world that is so disconnected appreciate the technology the facile togetherness and above all the high level of participation from seemingly unknown people but united in thought and emotion its like the unmanifest expressing itself through a hundred channelize voices sometimes diverse but focused on issues i guess the gravity even gets distributed with the potential to intensify when deemed necessary a brilliant platform
its okay but removing the likes makes it difficult to find new people that are similar to the current person i am following it helped me discover people i otherwise would have passed up as well as giving a preview what they normally post probably will not use the app as much as i used to with it gone since it was easier to look through followed likes maybe a better workaround be to make likes hidden by default and give the account user the choice instead of removing freedom of choice
twitter used to be good man ever since x happened its been trash it sucks to see it go down the toilet bots running rampant posts fail to load videos take forever to load the only reason i stick around is cause of my friends thanks for nothing elon
what makes this ecosystem great are the content creators using this platform however the app itself has taken a downturn in terms of stability and performance it suspiciously uses many gbs of data fails to load many times have video playback issues and also funnily creates millions of impressions on some specific videos if you post them under your account
this app has loads of problems from not loading content dms notifications not being pushed through and not seeing your who dm list that you been talking too i have to manually type in their name in the search bar just to recover the dm on my list then this app crashes and refuses to open sometimes i may use the platform but this app needs to be fix i only prefer old twitter because at least the app wasnt this bad
incredibly frustrating app to use despite having good internet connection content will simply refuse to load content refreshes suddenly and a post i was about to click on is gone forever the increased engagement farming and ragebaiting from accounts is extremely mindnumbing i shouldnt have to spend my time on the app blocking all these the only good thing is i still get to see cats on my timeline
it is now the ultimate crowdsourced most quickly updatedcorrected news source in the history of man its also so easy to use now and wildly more informative than it was in the past elons right that this really is the global town square and thank god everyone has access no more suppression no more rigging the game were no longer dependent on an ideologically monolithic news media free at last
the reason behind four star is there is an issue found by me that two or more media played at a time and it is irritating the users because human ears cant understand or more media or voice at a time so the developer should handle this errorbug if we have two posts on our screen then both to post media is played at the same time and this is very big big and big error or bugs you can say
i just use this to follow a few specific people but it keeps nagging me to add my contacts to turn on notifications and other suggestions asking once is enough and i have zero intention of doing so asking me over and over again including trying to block my use if i refuse to use the not now response give me a permanent no option or similar is not going to change my mind and now it will automatically switch to a new video when the one im watching is finished instead of looping
my god what a useless app no matter how strong your internet is it doesnt load pictures and videos it takes forever to load one picture so frustrating and the setting placements are so random i have to watch tutorials to customise my settings bring back the old twitter now
as a tool to communicate on social media its still one of the best but objectively as an app this is getting ridiculous nothing has been loading as of late images take forever and videos are all getting playback errors bots are still rampant and its getting harder to have fun with this app
great app would love for the like viewability to come back has some glitches on media reproduction but cant seem to verify if its an app problem or cache problem but sometimes freeing the cache data doesnt help when the problem presents itself
x has quickly become my goto app for realtime news and conversations the interface is intuitive and i love how it keeps me informed on trending topics however theres still room for improvement in curbing misinformation and hate speech despite this x offers a unique platform for connecting with others and staying updated
feed is now quite abrupt seems that everytime i refresh feed it changes between a few set themes which contains very similar posts this makes it non comprehensive it will keep on showing similar content if you dont refresh refreshing feed itself is quite slow task and sometimes even gets stuck
dreadful app alienating experience with inexplicable changes endless scrolling video on a blogging app why buggy repeated badgering for personal info the mechanics are frustrating for an year old product that should be slick and streamlined it adds endless bloat for no reason other than ape other companies software
why was so much data being collected without my consent you need to put in big plan bold letters we are stealing your data not hide it away in a small section of the settings what a slimely practice also its possible to make a uncheck all button so its easier to opt out of interests interests that are collecting random information from other apps i use without my permission and also making the opt out process a pain in the behind nice app elon
was great when elon first bought it but the last few months are trash still tons of censorship but the worst aspect is that they harass you with loud autoplaying music on temu ads every posts or so you cant skip or block or mute them to avoid it and x doesnt listen no matter how much you hit the i dont like this ad button i think theyre trying to harass people into paying for premium but its a shady business tactic and makes me want to uninstall permanently
the experience of using this app gets worse every day somehow app constantly bugs out and doesnt want to refresh cant change my profile picture verified and unverified bots everywhere especially under verified tweets its just so garbage now somehow they found a way to make this app worse than facebook
was hoping i can find something funny on my timeline today but app was like no funny endless loading for you and i was like okay whilst sad violin endlessly loops in the background like this app unfunny jokes aside i kept getting this endless loading thingy and its very frustrating when i want to look up something funny and just cant so do something about it or dont do whatever you want i guess
forcing a random video to auto play after finishing a video is never convenient for the user not being able to disable that feature is annoying to the point where i use the app less now i go from a video where someone is showing off tattoos to a man getting his head stomped until its spaghetti sauce its like the app is trying to make every feature unbearable on purpose
i enjoy the wide range of differing thoughts and opinions allowed on this platform unlike instagram for example so far theres no mysterious bans if you get a strike you know why people try to pump up their traffic by posting unrelated content as a response in a highly trafficked response thread annoying ads arent too bad so far it is a great alternative to other social media outlets suck on it zuckerberg
its the best app where one receives news from worlwide within seconds and many news agencies use the same x app for getting news and breaking it on their tv shows secondly it gives chance to everyone to connect to anyone in the whole world making it a global village thirdly its easy to access even when there is low internet speed so i have always found the app beneficial
this app in the current state is unusable images are not loading videos have playback erorr comments are full of ads ive muted hundred of accountsvideos doesnt have correct comments in playerapp auto refresh when you go out of video player still unusablei got continues ads in the same page
thank you for enabling voice notes for android i really appreciate it i gave you stars because i hate the fact that you limit the people we can follow you limit us for months on end thats very frustrating the issue of verification is a very sore issue the fact that i can only be verified only if i subscribe is very unfair i believe that people who have been using the x app for over years who are using their real names and real profile pics deserves to be verified
the app wont show the images or play videos even if i have a strong internet service i tried to refresh uninstall and install it back restart my phone but it is still the same i tried switching to a different account to see if it will work but it didnt
the problem i got is this issue of account suspension sometimes you are left in the dark and not knowing why is your account suspended or blocked you can make an appeal but you receive no prompt response or no response at all as x is one of the reliable and trusted information and messaging platforms account suspension and blocking may lead to a great loss but its an overall great experience love it
whatever youre doing with the videos for the last week or isnt working playback errors galore even if that got a little better now vids randomly pause in the middle and still too many ads especially going from videos directly to them ruins the whole vibe from the way yall were trying to be like ig tiktok well not anymore not now hope the temu money was worth ruining the app
app is good for techstartupsnetworking etc but there are sort of glitches on the app which needs to be fixed while speaking on spaces i have noticed that sometimes speaker isnt shown also if the person is speaking contains a lot of spammers
content loading most of the time and nothing is happening video launched by itself and song continue even if youre scrolling and even if another video starts so its overlapping live sessions are really bad feel sometimes ghosted by x and all these fakes likes coming from nowhere from fake accounts is really annoying me
the app is performing well the problem is with the soundwhen i scroll to the next video the sound of the previous video is still on so you get to hear two differences sounds in one video which is very annoyingand i have to go back to the previous video and mute itdevelopers should work on that
since elons take over the app has never been more bugged out i open the app to find the tl refuses to refresh constant flood of adds now sometimes in a row private chats will not load up either messages sent but not received the bots have been at an all time high worst part is the change of your preferences i see things i have no care for he ruined the app
app unusable when a charger is connected everything stops loading and takes a very long time to begin functioning again sometimes turning airplane mode on and off fixes this but not often feels like bias towards ios since i dont run into problems there
cant use the chat on the app keeps crashing and says something about a cache error the app overall feels super deprecated since the shift from the blue bird app era free speech but misinformation can spread like wildfire and the community notes barely make a dent into this ban accountsips that are known to be malicious users simple as thatll solve half of the issue absolutism is embarrassing
i just resubscribed and i cant use any of the paid features which is frustrating im a full time content creator and i want to be able to use the features i paid for i keep getting asked to subscribe after i literally just paid and i cant contact support either because they have a prompt that says only subscriber can get help through messaging so i keep getting asked to subscribe
july videos keep freezing its been happening for over a year now and no improvement or fixes nothing ive done to work around it and get it to stop has worked its not worth logging in anymore august this new auto advance feature is horrible no one likes it and there is no option to stop it from advancing automatically to the next post on an android i like this app even less
i have used twitter for a while but on my main account it takes minutes to load my timeline i have an alt account which works perfectly fine as it seems this app is only glitching on mobile devices i am unable to like posts and send dms after leaving the app open briefly without touching it i have updated the app to no avail i have opened it on the web and everything is fine fix your app
whats wrong with the trending spot its filled with ads and no useful tweets and it ends with like tweets only edit i posted this review years ago and the issue hasnt been fixed yet shows you how much the developers cares about this app yeah and now for some reason images and posts wont load at all even though my internet is working fine
push notifications are still very broken along with many other features plus now i keep getting moved to the next video after the one im currently watching finishes which is something i never wanted the fact that i cant turn it off is highly frustrating
the june algo change completely ruined this app instead of interesting content you get bottom of the barrel stupidity tik tok style nonsense and political hate commentary from the left and the right there is no way to really turn that off i tried hitting not interested muting people etc its a shame as i was relying on this app for news and interesting topics
its and im removing my previous star rating from and rating it star now the app has been a disaster it logs you out for absolutely no tangible reason and i cant deal with the stress of login in everytimetweets are also repetitive on your timeline this app used to be fun you can do better
show more posts on someones profile needs to be removed if you dont press this as you are scrolling through a profile it goes from the most recent posts on that profile to posts from days ago skipping a large amount of posts why cant it be like its always been top post is the most recent and as you scroll the posts get older all without pressing show more posts i shouldnt have to keep pressing a button every ish post to load the most recent ones
good so far but still needs improvement in reaction button there must be some other options as well as there must be an option of people who have seen a photo or watched video annoying notifications such as based on what you have recently seen must be stopped except your followers or likes
avoid this website at all costs i mainly use it to view art and keep up with some content creators since the app was purchased i keep getting recommended white supremacist and homophobic accounts no matter how many i block more keep appearing it feels intentional or at the very least the algorithms seem designed to promote outrageous content i strongly advise people to stay away from this mess of a website
dont know what the issue is but whenever i plug my phone to charging and open x it fails to load any tweets when i use it without charging it works normally noticed this trend multiples times please fix it july this issue is still occuring aug the development team is blind confirmed
bad used to be good before free speech man decided free speech for me not for thee bought it half the time i cant use it cause the app cause its stuck unable to load new content outside of whatever is preloaded into the cache the rest of the time youre forced to look at chan level posting but not funny
i like to use this app but often when i open the dm and reply to a message suddenly the app shuts itself down and its not one or two times at a time it can be up to five times in a row this makes it uncomfortable because i have to repeat to reply to the message
this is my favorite app but recently it has been functioning terribly and has become tedious to use it buffers forever and hardly loads the problem isnt internet connection because the other apps work fine i have installed all updates still nothing so disappointed and frustrated fix it
well this was a good app then musk got involved and now it doesnt refresh or load properly videos get stuck with sound still playing frequently crashes and closes the content is so heavily biased to his views seriously wish he came nowhere near twitter which it will always be x what a stupid name
the mobile app has been super glitchy lately videos frequently come up playback error and wont play feeds take forever to load and the for you tab keeps recycling content i saw earlier in the day the random bots that follow my account are up exponentially and the comments under tweets are all spam upside im using the platform less frequency and am enjoying not wasting my day on this hot piece of garbage
after video ads was added its neen very unstable crashes multiple times every hour i will only use x on a computers browser equipped with ublock origin or similar ad blocker the app has become terrible and is not usable anymore also it occupies atm mb on my phone thats just horribly engineered phone and its lagging and crashing constantly
of all the social media apps that i open on a regular basis x is the only one that only works half of the time the other half of the time it doesnt load or none of the pictures load the app is becoming unusable at this point
elon turned twitter into hot garbage not many good changes bad integration for most of them based on the structures intent it was designed for pics clips to be shared reading tweets and online interaction thats it the video quality is still a complete joke when more features get piled on it loses its identity functionality and most of the user base others including myself have compared the ui to a porn site the plauge of horny bots on the platform does not help its case either
refreshes my timeline without prompting when this issue wasnt occurring before the update removed public likes is full of bitcoin ads with links you can accidentally click the mobile app still doesnt let you change your profile pictures absolutely horrendous
why does your app not go through with profile picture changes i go through the whole thing and it looks like it went through with no error messages and then it just reverts back to my original profile picture and if i try to login from your website you log me out for suspicious activity like just let me change my profile picture which should be a basic feature for your social media platform
twitter sucks now back to back ads in a row videos no longer play they instead have a playback error and if you try to reopen the app to watch the video it gets refreshed and lose the video the app is completely useless no more videos
lots of scams in ads and replies direct messages frequently crash losing messages youre writing every release after may of wastes more battery after a video ends another random one starts playing theres no way to avoid it porn gore violence and offensive politics eg literal holocaust denial are recommended daily by the app
while the app gets worse in a bunch of high level direction ways the base level functionality is also falling apart app just randomly stops loading new post and media for long stretches of time maybe they shouldnt have fired a ton of the staff that kept the app working idk lmao
everyday basic content fails to load videos have a playback error and wont play or load at all seems like maybe server issues vs app issues not sure very frustrating the app doesnt load properly the majority of the time lately whatever the issue is even after resetting reinstalling etc
i am facing a big problem on x platform since many days when i open x app the app crashes after using it for a few seconds i try again and again to use x app but after opening the app for a few seconds the app closes and i automatically come back to the home screen of my mobilephone i created my new account on x app for the first time a few days ago and now its becoming the worst experience of my life i dont know what kind of problem it is but i hope you will take cognizance of it
so many times i just log on the app and like a couple posts then ill be locked out of my account and itll say it was an error then i wont be able to log back into my account for a bit of time its terrible cant even use the app if i keep getting signed out for no reason
app experience has drastically gotten worse over the last years between the blatant political biases being pushed into your feed on non political pages forced interest application to various meme and news pages that if removed come back within a few days to now videos immediately autoplay into the next swiped up video which could be literally anything no way to disable im so over this app original rating from was such a better time the app deserves to have ratings reset its bad
ultimately its an informative and entertaining app when it works my account still isnt right nobody responds to problems and i had to create a second account when my first was hacked by someone who changed the contact info
been using the app for years but now it refreshes the feed by itself the videos always have a playback error and refuse to autoplay even after ensuring that it is enabled in settings the ads are getting ridiculous at times the entire page is just full of ads
x is hands down the best platform you will ever use it has the most up to date info on any trending subject including everything from cats to wrestling i enjoy the trending financial information you can learn my favorite thing is you get the ability to stay up to date on what the coolest dude on the planet is ushering into this ever changing world if you enjoy good info and awesome opportunities to learn about the future and a occasional laugh get yourself a x account you wont regret it
the x app keeps refreshing itself and sending me to the top of my timeline and making me miss the posts i havent seen yet please fix this its frustrating the translator of the app also doesnt work when there is a post with a picture
ive been enjoying twitter for many years ever since the change of ownership for twitterx ive been getting likes and retweets from suspicious profiles almost like bots profiles with xxx women its clearly noted in their bio that their profiles are xrated for those that dont have actual visible xrated posts its dutifully noted in each bio its horrible out of control and shameful to continue to ignore this problem im starting to think that x stands for xrated
what a disgrace what elon did to one of the most popular social media platforms so bad that people to this day including me still call it twitter and not x its so bad now this among the other things is one of the dumbest things i have seen from any app as soon as i connect my charger the app has troubles connecting to the servers as though i had a bad internet connection this only ever happens as soon as i plug my charger in and the connection issues persist for hours
its great to be able to find real and up to date content on all the inetests i have thoughts about of course theres rubbish and controversy but valid discernment brings us to coalesc what we find to add to our stance on the issues will grock be free to retirees videos posted live are hard to argue against and stand as truer than the postedit versions on news i go for current status of news here on xhope you will develop a more balanced newscast in future using validated x data
crashes constantly cant even type out a basic tweet without the app closing so then im forced to repeat this process like times before i can actually type the tweet out elon continues to ruin this app in every update even while typing this i got an error message that twitter crashed dont bother downloading this app if you want basic functionality
feed refreshing automatically right in the middle of when youre reading an article most of the times tweets just keep loading upon app opening it was flawless and stable when it was just twitter now it is becoming a piece of junk
incomprehensibly annoying app in almost every possible way videos constantly getting playback errors that seem to only be solved by clearing the apps cache solving the problem for all of maybe seconds ads on this app are fandom wiki tier insufferable of the same crypto scam autoplay ads in a row every nd post if that wasnt enough some of the most vile content pushed onto the feed no matter how much you try to get this app to understand you arent some form of nazi skull measurer
an ad would insert itself into my timeline and it would freeze my phone for a long period of time until it processes the video what makes it worse is that it loads the same ad three times in a row making this period longer than it should
helped me relearn communication x marks the determination to share by limitations an odd framework to hang process on but it worked to define my improvement from a paralytic situation now i dont give a damn yer awl crazy now
i dont know why but this keeps acting up it takes way too much time to load and now it is not even showing anything and there is no way my network as any problem it is working smoothly with other but x is just lagging its such a great app it has everything like meme funny videos friends information and much more so please do something i wan na enjoy it
this app somehow manages to not work way more than it does its always a gamble when i open it whether the content will actually load or not but it seems to be heavily weighted toward not its astounding how much more garbage this app has become in recent times seems that everyone agrees but the bad ratings are being hidden by a flood of ai generated star reviews absolutely abysmal
not only is it full of racists its also a barely functional app ill get like repeating ads back to back and they keep spawning or deleting as i scroll so its basically impossible to interact with any tweet that has the misfortune of being next to an ad
takes too much time to refresh feed load new content media such as pictures gifs and videos wouldnt load even in the feed this happens even when i am connected to wifi and can browse through the internet at ease ive seen similar complaints regarding the same hope they will fix it asap
its official this application is not usable anymore spaces dont play audio after minutes in and the whole features of resource hug meaning it can drain batteries within hours there is a number of issues with logging including autolog out and even after cleaning cache and deleting all data related to the application its still is able to login without asking this is complete disaster
constant playback error occurs when attempting to watch videos seems to fix temporarily when clearing cache but quickly occurs again after as little as a couple seconds or two videos etc never used to occur up until a couple months ago
used to be great but getting an account suspended after years makes the app much less enjoyable pretty sure i was targeted by a bot attack there is no customer service also if you have an account suspended you lose all the money for any account youve subscribed to great app but suspensions with no recourse is bad for customers i was a premium plus subscriber for at least half a year and there is no priority for customer service for paying around a month had over k followers too
i have not totally had much time lately with the app like i would like to however the owner is a genious so you know that its going to be robust for mr reeves ive had the opportunity to collaborate with him and i find him down to earth not at all negative ive checked in every now and then and the application is crystal clear with its interface and features that i have not learned to use yet ive watched videos and tweets on it and found some interesting things in there and its serious
thank you for addressing some of the issues but i still cant see all my tweets in the posts area sometimes theyre scattered so that the most recent tweet is two hours old and the next one is from minutes ago additionally i cant play any videos when i click on them despite having no network issuesadvertisement videos play without problems there are still many bugs that need fixing ive been using this app since and i hope you can resolve these issues to keep the app enjoyable
i enjoy the x app very much ive found some very good channels good resources that provide accurate information based on facts not feelings or a ideology ive also found channels that sending out some good energy that is received in gratitude thank you the creative memes will cause you to laugh till your sides hurt x has channels for many interests i look forward to finding more to subscribe to
im gon na be honest its a good social media app ive been able to follow everyone that i want to and all of that previously but the app has been so broken recently i havent been able to view any posts or anything on my timeline for like a week it acts like i dont have internet when i do and even if it does work its only for a minute or so
removed visible likes teaming with bots verification system is shot and no longer useful for identifying reputable accounts it instead boosts paid accounts to the top of the replies instead of being a meritocracy where the best filter up but im sadly addicted save yourself and dont download
ive been using x for a while now and its been a fantastic experience the apps userfriendly interface and smooth performance make it a pleasure to use every day i especially appreciate the trending topics and current news features which really set x apart from other apps in the same category
nothing loads properly videos take forever to pull up feed pictures dont show replies to tweets fail to load cant search anything i used to rely on twitter for real time accounts of all events sports weather news now i cant load anything whether its in the seatch function or elsewhere app is now trash
aside from the political issues stemming from the app now being owned by a man child there have been a multitude of constant bugs and design choices not being fixed the app doesnt refresh or update on screen content when charging any posts you like get unliked a couple seconds afterwards youre stuck with constant loading icons until you unplug the phone and refresh the app
will every once in a while stop loading anything liking retweeting will not work and refreshing will just continue to load every other app i have that uses the internet will work fine but this wont unless i uninstall and reinstall it not to mention it randomly force auto refreshs making it near impossible to find anything you were previously trying to read or retweet
i havent used twitter for a long time and logging in is very difficult now where i have forgotten my username and all i have is email and password but the application whose name has changed to something strange insists on asking for a username that i cant remember i only remember the email and password i used no wonder the rating is so bad
i have enjoyed this appsocial media source for years now except in the past years a number of irredeemable changes have affected this scorerating these are changes that must be rectified change the app from x back to twitter or announce why x is the ultimate new ip expression and commit to it x root to stem stop gatekeeping features with premium pricetags get appropriate monetaryuser values demandutilityetc for each feature price all featuretiers accordingly
the app is ok if your looking for a social media app but it keeps being finicky when it randomly decides to log me out and thinks me trying to log back in is someone else even though it is me one time i logged back into my account and everything was gone all my posts even though there werent lots and everyone i was subscribed to was gone i wasnt getting recommended anything or any one i liked anymore my account was basically completely reset which was by all means upsetting
restoring freedom of speech on a platform like twitter is a huge step to preserve freedom as a whole in america and around the world the app is better than ever easy to navigate uniting people around the world update too many community notes made me have to start all over again when my previous account was restricted to read only and my growing audience was suddenly reduced to zero looks like the no freedom of speech left has infiltrated x once again just in time for the election
im using a google pixel s this app will not let me and other people login works perfectly fine on my ipad are the people at twitter not testing their app on the latest stock android version maybe only iphones are important for stability ill stop trying to login so as not be locked going back to instagram to keep up with the internet
this app sucks at loading photos when i installed this app then after two three days when i opened the app there showed can not retrieve posts at the time then after i checked again and same happened please solve it it is a big issue for me and others users
currently x aggressively pushes content that fits their algorithm regardless of whether or not its relevant to you instead of game dev and other interests i used to see on my feed ive seen people dying in several ways porn politics regarding other countries im not remotely close to content i cant even read because its not in my launguage and other content that is either irrelevant to me or deeply disturbing this was done to make x more profitable at the expense of a decent platform
not being able to turn off autoadvance on videos is incredibly infuriating having to log in to see anything makes it so needlessly time consuming to open from any other app about in posts on my feed is from someone i actually follow
app doesnt work while charging apps lags after prolonged use does not show the full follow list of other users as well as my own also when browsing the following list when going into an account and coming back to the list it takes you back to the top which is extremely frustrating
this app refuses to let me use it cant log in using google it just redirects me to the login page cant log in with my account because i dont remember my old phone number and apparently theres no way to reset any of it without remembering it tried making a new account with my phone number and i tried to open the app and it asked me to verify my account with my email because of suspicious activity i didnt use an email so theres no way to do anything with it
used to be a but now dropped big time app crashes constantly where my feed wont update notifications from days ago randomly popping up and verified accounts get priority of viewing when posted as replies under tweets but often simply just farm interactions to make false accounts look genuine really poor only thing stopping it getting is the introduction of community notes which have really limited fake news being shared without context
feels like whatever worked under the prior leadership was scrapped when elon took over dms sometimes barely function retweets or quote tweets sometimes function poorly views on posts seems stupid a potential dislike button might be added the layout of the mobile app feels so much different it functions but there are so many ads and bots just poor all round rehire a team to clean it up so it can return to the performance it had pre elon please
for the few months since ive joined x to get liberty freedom and justice the app has been good not sure if its my phone that makes the screen and keyboard freeze up got a new phone and its happened once already in the past week i just close the app and reopen it you would help me out tremendously if you could create an edit post option my situation is a really long story and posts end up out of order because im still new and not sure how to add on more testimony thanks you
cant log into account ever had a twitter account back when it was a cesspool got the account and never used it forgot the username and password but still the email is associated with it my google account email nobody ever got back to me when i reached out soill need to start a new email account for just x or i can neverever have an account
app hasnt worked for months doesnt load new tweets media or profile pictures on occasions constantly have to fully close out of the app and reopen it for any hope of it working not to mention the bots taking over including on these reviews absolutely terrible experience at the moment
i love the x its sharp shows the important info updates over overprrsonalised content its being less addictive im keeping it in my phone over insta deleted the insta ive started x profile and keep posting it being medico but the target audience are like model figures fake ids rather than actual people ideally target audience should be medicos anyways overall please keep it great over big i love it x
it just doesnt work want to follow someone you cant do that until you add a phone number but i already did add a phone number also the app will randomly refresh in the middle of scrolling so you just lose whatever post you were looking at
most times i open this app after its dark out it just gets stuck in endless buffering it has been like this for months edit months later this still happens it just chooses at random when it wants to load images or anything new
i really like this app its useful for business and keeping up with the latest trends but its still not perfect since it sometimes recommends stuff that falls outside of my preferences that i dont intend to interact with
every time i make a twitter account someone says something hurtful to me and i say something slightly insulting and they locked my account i tried to unlock my account by verifying my phone number and they didnt send me and email worst social media since reddit edit got suspended last week would rate stars if it was possible
twitter feed breaks when charging my phone loads fine then i plug in my phone to charge try to reload twitter feed stops loading everythings all black restarting app and clearing cache or data doesnt do anything only fix is to unplug phone and restart the app
cant even log in to my account really got bad experience in trying to retrieve x account via sms text message very bad user experience i dont even received any messages from your team even ive waited for hours for the code thru my phone number also x mentioned that ive done too many attempts to retrieve my account ive reported this n still no response email in return fix this asap please i just wan na retrieve my x account
this app is constantly breaking down sometimes it doesnt want to load anything videos take forever to play sometimes it swipes itself up to something else the report system is terrible blatant racism etc is never addressed or dealt with harassment and doxxing is rampant bots are everywhere way too many scam ads just a poor experience all around no one sees my posts so engagement even with moots is so low its depressing update its even worse now slowphone is hotmore ads thanb
constantly crashing now cant scroll for more than a few minutes without the app closing shutting down
with the latest version of the x app on android i couldnt save images to the device or share the post with other channels
the ability to stay in touch with our countrys leaders is important and this apps keeps the line of information and communication does exactly that thank you x
aug update still closing my account for unusable activity yet i still have not posted antinging in over a year now have you notice that the following section are of accounts that you dont follow very bad app who every is updating all needs to be fired old review very bad they keep closing my account saying unusual activities meanwhile i havent posted anything for over months i do go on to see other people post but thats it please check the way you do things
broken app i have issues to refresh the main page also playback error every time regardless connection type wifi g g its so annoying used to be very fast and i get constant meaningless ads not sure what they changed but it was better before
ive been facing a problem for a long time my account keeps logging out automatically its already happened four times many of my friends have also faced the same problem today when i was changing my profile picture i noticed a black square in my profile picture that doesnt exist in the original picture please solve these problems
has been working fine until the november update now it hangs at the x logo splash screen of the times i open it
when phone is on charge app is unusable refuses to refresh or load new content even at near full charge even afterwards the app needs to close reopen close reopen etc to get it to refresh has only been happening over the last few months
x is a great app to use especially if youre a lover of ever evolving news by the minute the only problem i have with this app is that when you comment on a tweet it appears on your page and its just too many unnecessary posts
i upgraded to the first premium level to write longer posts and avoid seeing ads however im disappointed that i cant even see who liked or replied to my own posts on my own profile page at all if i had known this i wouldnt have upgraded its not worth the extra cost this app still has a lot of flaws
ever since the update for the for you tab ive come across a lot of racism nazis and gore videos of either people dying or people killing animals on my feed this app has been gradually getting worse and worse edit the app is literally unusable everytime i open it it crashes and gives me a x has stopped working message its very slow and laggy and doesnt load my feed or notifications edit app is still super buggy app still constantly crashes
link more info describes the problem with setting but does not lead to the place to fix it and asking got it of course not i checked all settings cant see what else i can change to send messages may be i just can live without x and be just fine
for the past couple of days i have been struggling with this app it chooses and picks when it wants to work images will not load videos will not play timeline will not refresh i can not tweet booo elon
i just updated my x and it keeps auto refreshing my timeline cant even finish reading posts because it keeps refreshing almost every seconds pls fix this its so annoying i could no longer interact with random posts because it will be gone it just a matter of seconds
the app is constantly breaking every day nothing will load in the app for anywhere from minutes to an hour its not a connection issue because the mobile site loads everything something ive only seen in the past year or so
multiple times day the app will just stop loading anything despite my connection to the internet being strong happens in multiple locations on various wifidata elon musk has destroyed the functionality on the app and x is a stupid name for an app ive tried everything but the entire app just stops working randomly
am a big fan of infinix product but i just realized so late that infinix has the slowest connection to data network i was in a meeting with friends and i realized that everyone was browsing so comfortable with mtn except me even though there was bad network in the area at that bought i was filled with regret why i bought the lastest infinix instead of redmi or samsung honestly something should be done about it
x stands out as the leading social media and communication tool offering a comprehensive allinone platform for various needs compared to its predecessor twitter x provides an enhanced user experience with integrated features and streamlined functionality since elon musks acquisition the platform has seen notable improvements making my engagement more frequent and satisfying than ever before if youre looking for a versatile and effective social media solution x is the best choice
twitter now has significantly more ads constant porn bots in the comments of posts that are completely innocent and has a verificationpromotion system that is used by people to make revenue reposting others content instead of making something interesting the only reason im still on this app is because some of my favorite artists are still on it i am working on migrating to different platforms and really hope something else manages to become more mainstream
maybe if x team can fix the bugs and improve the system i will change my rating these days the dm fitur often stops abruptly while im typing message it bothers me so much ps it happens to my friends too so
the find page shows ops somthing went wrong but dont worry its not your fault i dont why its happening i cant see whats trending or anything i have done everything from reinstalling the app to logging in but nothing works please look into the matter
cant open the drafts literally just blank even though i never logged it out doesnt let me update tweets arent loading from time to time doesnt let me search through dms andor posts doesnt let me play videos with the amount of playback errors every time its been months since this happened and still no fix
love this app but recently the amount of adsrepeated ads are horrible usually get of the same exact ad in a row not even exaggerating the i dont wish to see this ad thing doesnt work and posts are repeated after refreshing
stops working for hours on end every day just refuses to load tell elon he sucks also the app puts up ads that arent labeled as ads which im pretty sure is illegal i continue to be a huge fan of how the app breaks for around an hour every night like clockwork
a majority of the time it just straight up doesnt work wont load anything have to restart and sometimes that doesnt even work not to mention that lack of moderation lots of bots and links and such
was good until elon bought it now it takes minutes to load picturesvideo sometimes it wont load new tweets at all tweets fail to send and require multiple tries entire thing moves slow like it regressed to but the website version works like a charm
every useful feature is locked behind a paywall zero support team for assisting in issues oh and they hand out permanent suspensions like hotcakes and you cant appeal them because everything is automated with their perfect ai team and they provide zero reasoning on why or auto respond with the same noninformative emails
the app is incredibly broken posts from pages that i follow dont even show on my following tab most of the time but will pop up on the for you tab whats the point in following a page if it doesnt show where it should elon has well and truly broken this platform
doesnt work anymore randomly loggs me out images wont load not keep blocking my account for no reason customer support is non existent it was better when it was twitter elon ran this app into ground i give up on trying to regain access no one in the company will respond back there is no customer support of any kind i am dont with x
community notes introduced right before the change in management are the only good feature that sets this apart from other social media platforms they allow misinformation or sensationalized posts with missing important context to be factchecked however given that the current owner has been victim of them a few times im not sure how much longer they will last this platform used to be good
twitter has become a cesspool of toxicity and hate speech ever since that narcissistic muskrat bought out the company most of its advertisers have jumped ship due to his management as a result the feed is filled with back to back adverts of the save garbage mobile apps there are times ive seen ads in a row before i see a post made by an actual person the only way i can recommend using twitter is to use the desktop version with an ad blocker
this app is terrible massive downturn from when elon gutted the company changed every good thing twitter had accomplished and now only cares about trying to recuperate the billion he spent the algorithm is a nightmare and only shows posts that have been paid for to be spotlighted instead of things you actually might be interested in bot accounts run rampant ads have become egregious often showing up x in a row or you can spend month to bring back old twitter kys
what happened to this app it freezes a lot sometimes i would be reading something and wants to reply and it wont let me other time while i scroll and it freez the screen will suddenly turns black and there is nothing its not smooth like before and it gets worse with every new update
used to love this app so much but poor leadership has lead to a buggy oft unusable app i pray for the day it returns to glory
there is a character limit on messages but rather than cutting the message off at the limit it allows typing hitting send fails to send the overlong message but makes it uneditable so it cant even be copied pasted and resent in pieces not user friendly
platform to share your views on everything independently after transition from twitter to x its more transparent but can be more accessible of tweets those are not paying charges
app is alright except for wanting to change your profile image it gets stuck loading the image when you get to where they ask you to put out a tweet about the new image ive tried deleting cache and restarting my phone and nothing has fixed it
the live video stream works on the web browser but not in the app no errors thumbnail only no video just does not play the live stream that has ended plays but whats the point i did a full reinstall no change
the app sucks and barely functions anymore every day it takes about an hour to even work well enough to use at all also never use the drop down bar to send messages the app and your phone will probably crash
i have uninstalled and reinstalled this app for many times hoping it will get better but it stays the same it is constantly freezing i cant search anything i cant go through my notificationsand so much more bad things about this app its not fun anymore
terrible experience with the feed shows ads usually the same over and over again in a row and the feed will insert random content from celebrities and content creators who pay for you to see their posts after using this application since it has never been in a worse state
they need a lite version of this app also the constant freezing and crashing is frustrating to say the least i would give it a better review if the apps size wasnt so gargantuan and ran half decent but thats not the case its giant and runs terribly so it gets star
this app has so many bugs sometimes when i first open it it crashes or take freaking ages to load i keep getting video playback errors or images dont load other times if im on the app for more than mins it freezes my phone and causes it to reboot this app is absolute trash
so far so god great to get away from the censorship algorithm as it makes content of interest easier to find finding the menus a little hard to find things but very new here so im sure ill figure it out with use
i liked twitter now called x because of the wide variety of content that was available now im not so convinced my account of years was suddenly deleted after i pressed the like button on a picture with no trace of its existence email address device number username even password did nothing only option create a new account which i did and boom gone again after liking a picture
actually good but i js really cant open it sometimes js like my account being locked and said due to an error what error tho and now the pictures n videos arent opening its black out and i already refreshed soooo many times uninstalled and restart my phone so many times so annoying
i dont normally write reviews but the constant errors has me fed up my timeline wont load videos wont play its consistently a poor experience and theres no alternative it used to be cool to see folks you know on the timeline but its just gotten so bad
this app is becoming unusable frequently fails to load new tweets for significant periods of time and the constant playback error on videos is extremely frustrating embarrassing performance for the app of a major social media platform
about of the time the app just outright fails to load new content also the autoplay on videos is very annoying they dont even give you the option to loop a video so if its a really short video or one thats meant to loop it just doesnt work
when i open the app it just takes ages to load to the point where it just doesnt load so i have to restart the whole app just to get my homepage to refresh whenever you press and check the replies of someones posts you get bombarded with ads completely unrelated to the post its just infuriating
its indeed a great social media application quite informative and educational as a user information from all over the world can be read and that includes extended views on the tweets kindly include a menu for display theme so that users can decide on either dark or light themes for night and day time respectively currently the theme changes are automatic and not user implied guided
there are too many glitches it freezes and the app crashes after minutes of use ever since the new update and please bring back the option of whether you want to separately quote retweet or just retweet a post update aside from the quote retweets the same thing from last year is now happening again ever since the new update update worst ebrandung of the name as more frequent crashes than ever bring back twitter fix the for you page and add back topics to mobile
the photos and videos are not loading i have cleaned my storage reset my phone and reconnected my wifi and mobile data but it still doesnt show anything please fix this soon i love using this app
one of the worst apps in terms of synchronisation i registered my account newly in browser in x then it asked me to download app for better experience which i did now i have logged in browser but in app it blocked me saying unusual login activity despite the fact that it wasnt even taking my username in first place
this app is getting worse by the day ads are numerous and broken and the app pushes blue checkmarks opinions above others also the recommendations algorithm is trash and pushes outrage content like crazy trying to keep people fighting over trivial things i used to like this app now i have to suffer it
i recently switched to android from ios and my god the app support is horrible i pay month for premium service and i cant even change the theme from blue to pink not to mention the ui is laggy buggy and lacks premium features that i pay for and got on ios
the app has lost whatever was once good before the current owner may have had some intentions to make it better but it has severely backfired and took a turn for the worse it is filled with bots and engagement farming accounts with nothing good anymore just unrelated sludge and porn the downfall of this app has made me retract my opinion that elon musk is a genius
for the past several weeks the app has been sending ads before seeing anyone elses posts videos has a playback error after minutes of using it and currently nothing is loading at all and everything is a blank and ive deleted the app and reinstalled and the issue is still there
constant freezes on the main page behind ios updates so android users have to experience halfway functional features like autoplay video feedback with no option to disable it ios does adding functions nobody asked for deleting features that everyone assumed were a core part of the app plagued with bots and those bots will buy twitter blue which makes their replies funnel to the top of every post this makes replies unreadable until you get past the dozens that are just ai generated slop
never really used twitter before it became x and only recently started using this platform so far the experience has been good and i like being able to interact with other viewpoints i like being able to discuss politics and other social issues on this platform apart from my personal space on other platforms
posts just dont load no matter the network it will work randomly for a bit but hours out of the day no luck also is very obviously more of a cash grab since elon took over paid subscriptions locking previously free and good features constant bots everywhere with the new monetization systems twitter was social media x is nothing but a buggy money farm for elon
take too long to load like my internet was bad connectionbut another apps work just fine just the texts with no profile pics no media and take loooong time try to clear cache clear memory even restart my phone but nothing when charging or not this always happen you cant refresh twitter always the best
the ads is so annoyed no option to block or default setting to unmute so everytime the aps prompted during scrolling the music will blast off ive been clicking i dont like this ads multiple time everyday stupid apps stupid ads
in years ive never had big problems till this one started last year everytime i open my dms i get booted to my home screen immediately or a few seconds later i cant have any dm open for more than seconds max these days also this is the rd time just this week that my account logged out by itself and it just says logged out due to an error what error whats happening the first problem was fixed by then came back a month later and now this pls help
its hilarious how badly this app runs constantly crashes constantly cant load new tweets video playback is a complete joke the list goes on and on its honestly a much better experience to just use twitter in the browser on your phone at this point this app is maybe a step above malware
its gotten so slow and buggy and while ive mostly ignored it this new video autoplay feature they put in without putting an off button on android is stupid and makes me not want to use this app at all theyre completely neglecting the user experience
unusable app the feed refreshes everytime i open a video this used to happen sometimes but now its every minute this problem has been going on for years and its only gotten worse and its flooded with bots elon ruined this app
awful now for the second time now i paid for the most expensive premium and the instant i did my visibility got axed my comments are only visible to me no other accounts can see them and support haha good luck dms tweets to support and premium not even the usual unhelpful bot response which when it used to reply would simply direct you to a page that says to message the bot lol this app sucks now which is a bummer because before i tried it i was so stoked that elon got it
roughly half the time refuses to load anything new in the feed and can not be refreshed no error message or explanation so i feel like the server is just ignoring my accounts requests for no reason exiting and reopening sometimes gets the servers attention but clear they are seriously lacking in bandwidthexcept when it comes to spaces i never asked for nor enter unless you read other low reviews youll feel insane because no one talks about this glaring appdestroying problem
overall i enjoy the app but dm notifications havent been coming in at all even with all of the options turned on at first it was just the dm requests but now im not even getting notifications for dms i accepted
algorithm is messed up when i accidentally click only once on something im not really interested i get bombarded with content like that no matter how many times i click not interested but when i like something no content because feed is full of content i dont want musk why you had to buy and ruin beautiful twitter
overall quality of the app has degraded significantly in the past year or two ever since the buy out my feed has become inundated with nothing but rage bait random streetfight videos and just about every in accounts appears to be a bot
i have had my account for as long as i can remember with zero problems since switching it to x it keeps telling my my account is permanently suspended i have gone around in circles trying to figure out why ive filled an appeal and get a bogus automated response i need this fixed my kids school uses this platform for nearly everything we need to know and no one can help
the app is not functional and hasnt been for some time youll get an hour or two of it working then out of nowhere for no reason nothing will load no matter how good your wifi or reception is every other app will run fine but x will load nothing
going downhill thought musk would make this better and it is when it comes to free speech and expression but the app itself is constantly having issueskicking you outsuspending your account for literally no reason and has become immensely frustrating
awful autoplay function that cant be toggled off in a recent update especially terrible for short videos i cant even tell what i watched before it starts playing a new video thats four times as loud as the previous
app is terrible now all i get on my feed is random people ive never engaged with posting about topics i have no interest in all i do is click not interest in this post and this post isnt relevant or show less from xyz and yet i still just get the same topics and even same people pop up later x dont care and dont engage in fixing issues you address to the support handle
oh my i am so surprised at how bad this app works after a few years i decided to go back on twitter now x i had wretched communication problems with tech support and that has not gone away its worse in order to verify your account you need a telephone number so i add my telephone number after adding my telephone number i received a message that no changes my account is on restriction yeah dejavu tried contacting help and again no help
i really enjoy this app keeps me in the loop and gets me updated with all the local news and international but sometimes i see the same things over and over again it takes time for me to see updated feeds on my timeline this needs to improve
in the past year the app has become almost completely unusable for me about of the time when i try to use it nothing can load and the app freezes for hours incredibly frustrating
a change of profile pic will take forever to verify also android users subscribed to premium will not be able to upgrade to premium or downgrade if you pay for a year dont pay for a year and better yet dont pay for subscription at all
im never on this app apart from certain reasons and i will always still call it twitter because its way better than calling it x the app can never beat threads or anything like that
the app constantly crashes when i open it and it logs me out of my account when i want to log in it says im already logged in so in order for me to log in is to make a new account the new update with not seeing others likes is so stupid you could have find art through other peoples likes or new artists
unlike other apps you dont lose where you were if you need to get back to it later instead of automatically starting at the top of the page again it will pop up and notify you theres been more posts i love that feature i have the option to keep scrolling from where i left off or view the new posts
it just stops working timws i open it it does not load and when i open a video it does not play plus and worse of all it immediately shows me a different video after the first is over what is this tik tok instagram please dont
they are trying to force people to upgrade to premium by suspending their account i havent used x in a few months i open the app and i get a message that my account has been suspended it gives me the option to get more information and all that does is take you to the upgrade page
things have being going downhill for a long time the latest thing thats making me genuinely consider giving up the app for good is im consistently getting pushed right wing political posts that ive never shown an ounce of interest in on top of this videos never play they always say playback error
uninstalled and reinstalled loading issue fixed using mobile browser intead of app is waayyy more reliable for connecting and viewing unfortunately mobile browser doesnt soom to auto play videos wish i could give zero stars hasnt been usable for two days feel for those whose livelihoods depends on the app regularly bogs down to the point of unusable many minutes loading media with no results even restarting phone doesnt work anymore not sure if cache clearing issue or what
this app has fundamentally objectively gotten worse and not just because of the random feed resets the cutting of features like circles the overall poor app performance and other bizarre technical issues but the overwhelming amount of nazis and other bigots who both dont get banned but are pushed to the top of replies and feeds because they pay for a stupid blue checkmark terrible app run by a terrible person for terrible people
well i logged on after not using the app for a while it seems my account has been permanently suspended i was pretty excited when musk was talking about getting rid of censorship on twitter but now hes the guy stopping me from being able to talk on there i guess he didnt actually stand for anything after all if i cant talk then you cant mine my phone for information im uninstalling the app
went from to stars because they made peoples likes private i should get a say as to whether theyre private or not my boyfriend and i really enjoyed scrolling through each others likes and seeing what the other enjoyed watching it was a nice bonding experience and this change is depressing please give us an option to pick whether they are public or private
buggy and greedy absolutely rife with weird video ads that are both unblockable and somehow exempt from user autoplay restrictions an important accessibility feature for motionsensitivephotosensitive people like me and unless they give android users the same ability to disable video autoscroll as there is on ios i refuse to update this app again because it just keeps getting worse and worse with each new version musk managing to make every bad decision he possibly can at the helm
used to love this app now you have to subscribe for a fee to see post says my free posts is used up subscribe for more this is not freedom of information like what we were promised
i like x and its content since it is not a woke platform anymore however the app is a disaster often it freezes and it doesnt load anything the issue is there for hours fixes itself to break again later i rather use x from chrome this way it works perfectly
i am super sad over how useless this app is now theres some kind of limit over how many people i can follow and i refuse to belive i reached the limit myself i found many profiles that i follow that i actually never even seen before also the app lags as hell at random times of day no matter what source of internet i use so out of times i open the app the wheel turns around and shows me nothing awfully dissapointed
i absolutely love x i no longer need or use other apps its definitely worth it lol im totally going to geek out but this app is so awesome there are so many amazing features like hour video upload grok the incredible ai search assistant it does python you can ask it a math question by describing the problem and it will give you a formula you can make images and advertising is affordable and highly effective this is only a tiny fraction of why x is the best app ever
its clear no one on this app or elon cares to fix the amount of time it takes just to refresh this app its literally been monthssss it takes minutes just to refresh the app and i have video proof as to what im talking about if i need to send it to someone and no its not my app needing to be updated my wifi or phone data the apps catche phones internal space internet catcheex can we please fix it
the only app that bans you for no reason i dont know what i did wrong to be banned and the processes of recovering my account is very complicated im uninstalling this app
i cant use the app anymore it loads and loads for hours nonstop my connection is perfect and other apps work fine but this one doesnt work for me its like the app cant handle the amount of people using it
please enhance your mobile application to allow users to launch it immediately after download it would be beneficial to provide an option for users to either open the app directly or access their accounts through an alternative link this will help in reducing confusion and mitigating potential security issues associated with account access
this app has gone downhill since the new owner took over hes implemented all sorts of changes none for the better
after all these years the bugs of your for you page getting refreshed just out of no where while scrolling is still here and the bugs of not being able to scroll forever on android still remains makes the app totally unusable also btw the small dots next to posts are almost not possible to click anymore on iphone mini so i cant press uninterested anymore very frustrating i will be using my iphone mini for twitter instead of my new phone probably forever now cause it wont get fixed
suspended for sharing a political meme that was not against standards a very simple and silly meme nothing harmful this was over a year ago and i still cant access my account nor file an appeal they send you on a goose chase with page after page of instructions that lead you nowhere cant log in cant file appeal its all rubbish and ran by far leaning leftists fb is better than this social media platform and we all know fb sux
this app is deteriorating more and more out of posts in my home have absolutely nothing to do with my interests following or content i interact with even if i spend all my time on the app clicking on not interested nothing changes its also supposedly an app for freedom of speech but if you type words that the owner doesnt like your tweets get hidden and flagged as sensitive content even if its the most chill and normal comment everwhile actual threats go unpunished sucks
x is the best for privacy along with having many choices of entertainment you will find what you like and friends
would rate the experince seem to be more ads now those of us that have been with twitex forever would have been nice not to see them unlike a new user who just pays to get the blue checkmark instead even basic editing of a post needs to be paid for however whether youre a paid user or not new posts is not new posts anymore you get them from time to time but its just a recycling of posts mainly besides that the apps great
hey i am furious with the team of x i am using this app from yrs and now this app look totally messed if your authentication is very hard and tough for bots why you still removing multiple accounts after all verification if you have to remove after that verification why you are allowing to create multiple ids have some sense
ive had the app since and its never been this frustratingly bad to use recently ive been dealing with constant freezing pictures not loading at all the app refusing to open or refresh the report system is completely useless now and fully illegal content is not being removed from the site theres also been a huge surge in the amount of bots especially nsfw bots on the app everything about the app has been significantly worse for the past year
i hate the name but i love the way its set up now it can be overwhelming at first i love it way better than fb now days real ppl actually engage unlike fb where you actually know those ppl and they dont engage in anything but always watching this app is better for socializing for sure great for following your fav celebs and being able to engage with them on spaces just like station head was genius
its gotten way worse porn is running completely checkless with bots spamming every comment section advertising onlyfans x seems determined to destroy all the good features it has close friends circles public like count all is gone and done for we just keep using it out of sheer addiction hopefully one day ill uninstall it permanently seeing dashas and anna kachynian tweets are the only reason im still here
please fix and remove the auto reloading of the tweets and posts like meta it was really a good feature that twitter have unlike other apps so i dont know why it was removed please fix some bugs in playback errors i used to love scrolling and going back to the post i have left and now the one thing that makes twitter better is gone i hate to say that the older version is better if this is not fixed i will uninstall this if updates and add ons are quick then please fix the main issues
my account was suspended instantly without ever posting all i did was set it up and the repost a couple of elons post and i lost it tried to create another but it wont accept my email addresses this is ridiculous im new to this after avoiding it like the plague since i guess im not missing much set up another account and it was suspended again im done i aint bothering with it no more what a complete failure of an app
this app keeps freezing a lot at certain hours keep checking my wifi and mobile data but they are all connecting just fine except this one i would have to wait until the app is working again but it keeps doing it and its really annoying
i dont even like the application for personal reasons but thats by the way i have an account on x because of airdrops and other tasks and every time i want to carry out a task i either have to log in again or verify im human what nonsense i had to open another account because recovering the old one on a different device was taking time yet you wont even let me do my airdrops tasks in peace tck
x is where you get news first unfiltered news with unfiltered commentary when you know what happened last weekend x was the only place i could actually find out what happened due to corporate media not telling the story truthfully i use it more than anything else now
too many unnecessary dumb changes on this app not only the name to x but we want the name twitter back we also want our likes back as public stop hiding we never ask for it also too many ads not exaggeration but a lot and porn ads blasting on our faces when we are not asking for it ridiculous how this app became such a joke ah just like the owner a joke thats why this app is unusable anymore
many many bugs recently interrupted playback of videos fyp less organized and theres of course the constant ads everywhere comment section fyp videos all the same redundant ads lets not get into the explicit content under every comment section twitter really fell off
please just delete the video autoscroll feature or make it optional stop putting basic features such as dowloading videos behind a paywall fix timeline autorefresh bring public likes back or make optional fix report updates and add more categories to aboard specific issues listen to the community it is not that difficult
its a great app indeed it helps one get connected however i reckon there is a bug at the moment i tried logging into my account but it kept malfunctioning i tried updating the app yet the anomaly is still persistent kindly see to this
i mean its honestly unbelieveable to me how much worse products are made by billion dollar companies than small open source projects twitter itself is an arguably decent platform however this app is quite bad sadly jitter the animations are not smooth overall not a pleasure to use the new leadership seems to focus on much less important things than general user experience but here we go pretty mediocore laggy app
full of bots ads and messages trying to get you to pay for an app that now punishes you for trying to get engagement and likes have now become private so you have no idea what the person youre interacting with is like from a high level perspective i get it though too many execs were caught liking thibgs that would upset the shareholders so change the entire app instead of getting an ad account like the rest of us and stop destroying this app
fave social media website but the app is very weak multiple times a day it just wont load it only buffers random videos autoload now instead of letting you watch the one you clicked on again it was idiotic to fire so many employees that made the website function
terrible all around can you please fix the crashing especially with dms ill be in the middle of writing a dm and it crashes multiple times and deletes what i wrote for months if you want people to subscribe to the paid services itd be a good idea to make sure the app actually works the bots are out of control too i have to block several a day that follow me most replies and likes are bots also videos dont load now they want to sell our private info to a certain country iykyk
it is a good app on social media all information is available in a short time we can communicate with many people at the same time other media stops us that is why we should choose it i have been using it since and the experience has been good so far
best news and social app by far used them all but this one has all viewpoints and news on it independent citizen journalism is the way forward community notes are what fact checkers shouldve always been fair and impartial same as this app all opinions and free speech allowed within the bounds of the law whether u agree with the speech or not what western democracy was built on great app and will continue to use daily
fantastic scientific physics astronomy chemistry biology content balanced international news unfiltered reported by both sides
this apk is not good many lags avikhay use it disgusting i just didnt like it i dont prefer anyone to use it just delete this apk and u will save urself just trust me im engineer
very positive experience able to find the trees with in the forest able to find what im looking for not afraid to speak my mind
direct messaging dm still keeps crashing months on lucky to text or read a few words before the whole thing stops
every time i go to open the app in the morning it makes me wait an hour or so before it functions properly again this is uncalled for
great community great news awesome way to make friends im new at x but already have almost k followers vastly entertained discussing current events
x is giving me frustration i can not post pictures or upload pictures so why cant i not be able to post or upload pictures if you can fix it then means ill give you guys stars
so much better with free speechparodyverified legal by prof suggon deeznutzand discordit was unbelievably the worst censored platformand is now open free speech unfortunately cukoldberg metafacebookand instagramstepped censorship up in responseand instagram was once imo the best soc mediatied with misunderstood pinteresti always assumed pinterest was targeted towards women one day i looked havnt looked backit learns your interestsigpinterest almost all picsso much less bicker
best source for accurate information a great free speech platform highly recommend and the pro paid version is definitely worth it
i am experiencing an emotional breakdown after subscribing for x premium i dont get to enjoy it or even access my account because i was suspended allegedly for spam which i am not guilty of but you unscrupulous managers and admins of x that call yourself bot with low level intelligence went ahead to suspend me automatically worst app ever
highly biased app suspended my account twice without any reason some have reported account and they just suspended my account i cant even appeal to get back so much for freedom of speech
great app easy to use easy to connect with others if you want and easy to keep up with real news
very disappointed in this app free speech does not exist here your opinions will be throttled bluesky is a lot better and its not even close
i love the freedom of speech allowed the app keeps me up to date with the latest real news i think that this is the only transparent app that exists
after the trick of the last update i cant share videos and its stuck can you tell me why and what exactly do you want its not fare why did you locked my account what for i didnt share anything against your rules and locked my account for days
horrible dm system barely functional app and the owner just removed the block function the thing that you use to block people just terrible
excellent experience alwayspeople have found different ways to express theirselves otherpeople craves the other ones growth its ap private but still so public
i am very much excited to have x in my new mobile but i have problems in having it i usually spend around an hour in the morning and in the evening
also why is this app keep asking for me to keep logging back in then not accepting my google login details it beginning to annoying me putting me off using the app altogether update this is still happening even after an uninstallreinstall clear cache etc the worst app my phone keeps asking to put in deep sleep due to bugs get it sorted or is this to get people to pay for upgrade con
uninstalling the app not able to find my existing account by email id i clicked on forgot and provided email id after that it is still asking username
absolute trashcan of an app lol bots can wreak havoc rampantly hateful violent accounts are protected but human made personal accounts get suspended for bot like behaviour or simply following people retweeting tweeting etc you know the functions that are the entire point of this app every single time without fail for me and others i know also every repost keeps disappearing permanently then why keep that option why would i not want something that i reposted to remain reposted
app work good one complaint when opening app it shows some presumably older posts which sometimes interest me then after about half a second it updates with newer posts burying the older posts into oblivion would be nice if it did one of two alternatives either dont refresh with new posts on startup or keep my screen focused on the post which is first visible update update update app still updates feed on startup still buries old posts
if i can only give this i will do it my account been suspended for more than a week even i did nothing and they not email me for what happened just accused me and suspend i file an appeals almost everyday but no response this app is so draining now since they change the name from twitter to x i have important transaction on my account so how i can access it please do something about it team i need to get back my account as soon as possible
x is a platform for free speech i dont like every post i read either but defend your right to say it x has fulfilled that promise
this app has been the most frustrating social media app i have ever used inappropriate bots run rampant everywhere yet the accounts of actual people notably small artists or starting accounts gets restricted for botbehaviour like i got temporary flagged today despite not even opening the app the amount of posts replies likes follows everything i could do gets limited whats the point of using the app then yet the bot problem is still not fixed in the slightest
this app keeps getting worse with every new update do these things even go through qc before being deployed now the app just violently refreshes randomly
one of the most intuitive easy to use and free social media platforms have ever used in my life and im really happy that i have friends who turn me on to x
i joined x about weeks ago i love it i start my day reading x then to the robinhood page to trade crypto stocks i find alot about the companies on x very easy to get around
can only use it properly of the time the other i cant interact with tweets or search anything cant open chats or if i can open them i cant react wifi mobile data the experience is the same
loved it this is the only app i trust for truthful resources and news i love how communitu notes correct everyone who provide false information
im more comfortable expressing myself many people live alone x gives you a sense of having having someone to talk to without being told to shut up and it keeps you updated on world news
the only social app im enjoying this days its informative reaching and its a perfect app to share your daily regular and secret taughts in a context
subject account suspension issue and number verification dear x support i am facing an issue with verifying my phone number on my x account the phone number i wish to verify is currently associated with an account that has been suspended i have already tried recovering the account and followed all necessary steps but i have not received any response or resolution
its mainline reality unfiltered and tweaked to your preferences the best way to learn react interact and share with the world online
idk why it always suspends my new accounts as soon as i click follow button within a minute it suspends me and after that something is wrong something is wrong
i dont know what happened now i cant login my twitter account its showing something went wrong you have exceeded the number of allowed attempts please try again later
great but i want grok to be more interactive and have a read aloud button for all responses
pushes obvious propaganda and reinforces peoples biases and hatefilled minds with garbage so people get addicted with interacting with the app one of the world worse causes of brainrot
finally an app that gives android justice other apps like instagram arent very good on androids i hope x continues to improve on samsung devices
app is filled with bots and they recently made the block button useless you can still see peoples tweets even if youre blocked which goes against typical requirements for social media apps
so fun and engaging now censorship and manipulation has decreased my timeline of posts ends after a bit of scrolling instead of allowing me to continue scrolling through older posts
the app crashes anytime im opening a private message i hope this gets fixed
has performance issues sometimes but worth it grateful for at least major app that doesnt banshadowban for slightly offensive comments other social media platforms need to follow this example
advanced great experience great platform also number one for real news not fake news x is the place to be
this app is fun and informative lots of great art accounts to follow actual free speech is very refreshing
i love the old x old twitter i cant upload pictures from my gallery for the past few weeks so i got it updated and is still acting the same
the best app there is free speech is our right and x is the only app that allows it best place for news as well
best app you can have i get videos news friends and anything you want to say thats legal your free to do so thanks elon for buying x
overall its better than previous twitter but still has some small glitches here and there for example for notifications sometimes it will stay withe the content from last refresh so i have to get out of notifications page and get back again
its amazing as a digital artist and animatorwhen i post any animation video even at p in the browser version of x the quality is just below par on x app i understandthis platform is a social media platform but in this day and ageu should allow at least p quality in videos this makes difference between selling and not selling my art soplz push an update regarding this
twitter used to be great now it sucks its all ads and you dont see what the people you actually follow post
i highly recommend this app its worth using now and its very fast and responsive ive been using it for a short time and its worked well for me before i only used the web
x has completely destroyed the blocking feature people can still see posts from those who have blocked them i feel that this is a violation of user privacy and safety
love the uncensored nature though its double edged app itself is a bit glitchy and clunky grok x ai is pretty amazing tbh i paid for premium
probably the most significant app in the world because it is the global public square you have to sift through some garbage posts but there are some impactful people here
getting update news but sometimes some person spread wrong informationyou are requested to control to submit wrong messages and video
its amazing that there are no ads and its not the best as it will lag abit for me but overall im giving it stars for the effort
its almost a week since my account has been suspended and i have write appeal twice but still suspended i will be glad to be back online because have missed so many daily activities i cant do without x please help me unsuspend my account thanks amamotors
this app has become worthless its full of bots spam and ignorance bluesky is everything that twitter i receive ty use the other name always tried to be but never was
great service and very helpful i feel like x still has more space to create more tools and transform the application into a world compulsory web connexion
the absolute ultimate in free speech i use twitter to get most of my news and the fact that its not tied to the left makes it so much better
i love the x platform it is the best place to get news updates it is also great for social networking you meet real people in real time including big names its the absolute best platform online hands down you wont change my mind
sometimes itll let me post but then it just keeps on saying failed to send can this please be fixed its annoying
app has become a platform for hate speech and is constantly allowed and even incouraged the app also barely works videos wont play sometimes without restarting the app and posts wont even load if you have your phone plugged in
when i comment like etc no one can see it except me stop shadow banning me for no reason x or whatever you are i am not a bot i didnt break any of the rules yet still shadow banned i wont leave this review till the issue is fixed also there are like a million bugs none of them fixed
im really enjoying my time on twitter the platform keeps me engaged connected and informedalways something new to discover i lovetwitter x
love the platform but once ive watched or videos all posts thereafter buffer or wont play i ga e to close the app and come back to repeat text is fine juts any media wont load up
this is the truest source of up to the minute news tweeter used to be okay x is the best news app and source of news on the planet its the worlds town square thanks to visionary elon musk
would like it not to upload new tweets everyone i open want to read whats there first also why cant we edit our tweet for at least mins in case we find a grammer error
x has completely gurted the functionality of the block feature allowing people you have blocked to still see your tweets completely violating google play terms of service this app should be removed
great news source keeps me up to date in real time interesting and fun topics clips memes flow through my feed
twitter theres a reason a person deleted their tweets dont show me the tweet is deleted sign okay what do i do with that info when i cant even see or remember what they tweeted can you pls just take away that sign its annoying and useless
the misinformation is rampanti downloaded it and couldnt keep it used to be good when it was twitter
excellent platform fraud scammers require greater policing too much muskism otherwise i would have given stars
app doesnt load it has gotten worse and worse to the point i dont see anything but a dark screen this app sucks
everything about the app works fine but i dont use it often to know nitty gritty details about performance and usability really
it was fine for a while then it got bought out and sucked but at least it was still usable then i got flagged for manipulating experiences nothing i did was sourced as the violation i dont even post really and now ive been restricted from viewing any videosgifs my replies are hidden and its a practically unusable app also any blatant slurs literal criminal behaviour or harassment that i report gets dismissed near immediately
significantly improved since elon musk took over the program couldnt stand twitter before now im enjoying it features work better and content is more appropriate to my interests
great app since musk took over one of the only if not the only large platforms allowing free expression of views subscribe to x premium or premium plus to support free speech
love the freedom it brings just finally feel the truth is out there if you look in th e right places
great app that is solving the problem of free speech there is no way i will ever delete the x app from my phone it is my number one source of information
impossible to use authentication is a nightmare why do you have to torture people to use your platform good bye x and good riddance
it stops loading posts all the time and i have to wait a while for it to work again thanks elon
have had a great experience with the x app never used it when it was twitter i did not trust is as the reason i do not use meta
phenomenal app elon improved it so much ignore all the star reviews theyre just from lefties upset that all voices can be heard now instead of just their own elon also got rid of most of the bots that were bloating old twitter
seriously bad app kept going round in circles telling me theres a problem but do isnt say what gave up in the end total waste of time
finally a platform that honors free speech and thus democracy x empowers citizen journalism letting us throw off the yoke of corporatestate propaganda
very informative love the free speech from everyone and the freedom to express it
i like the content and ease of use i wish there were other like options other than just a heart
sooo many ads even in comments there are ads not really a functional platform anymore blue sky is way better
x is really helpful to understand the real policy makers and breakers thank you reaching and out me local business directory is must to boost any business development people are not using it for the shake of anything they are leaving and learning many more about life that is for today i dont believe in golden rules i believe daily routine morning to night evening to afternoon sir x always remaind y i should think out of the so i really appreciate and enjoying my
everything is good we need to be able to edit our post after sending it also please let us know if threed app continue with x app in same account
so my account was banned for absolutely no reason i didnt post anything i didnt comment on anyine elses posts or anything like that and my account was suspended without warning and without any kind of violationsx is now the new tiktok and i suggest anyine still using the app deactivate your accounts before they do oh and i had to give a star cause there wasnt an option for stars
x please fix your bug dms got error and freeze by itself lately fix it dms error account logout by itself empty timeline error gosh please fix it
having the app on background mode for some time makes the refresh feature bug forcing to restart the app
i feel better about this app than other social media it seems to be a great way to share ideas and information without constant misunderstanding and micro management
disregarding the political and moral failings of the owner which does matter the app is just not enjoyable to use with egregious bot infestations constant rage bait blatantly obvious algorithm designed to make you angry with a very clear political bias as well as increasingly dumb decisions being made on top verification not actually being verification blocks not actually blocking etc youre better off just unplugging from social media wholesale for the sake of your mental health
x still has a major problem with censorship but worse its full of bots and scammers its nearly unusable
constantly buffering and crashing even after updates seems like musk is struggling getting this together
i love it for a novice like me for example i am able to navigate some of the inquiries the users have i feel i am becoming addicted to it specially because elon is a great patriot the fact that elon seems to be so genuine with president trump and wants to help president trump this is a great access for the country thank you elon and gd bless you
suddenly stopped loading anything not my wifi or x being down i checked sites for down reports beforehand and other appssites work
i just downloaded and started using this app when i heard that all the libelrals hated it and so far i have to say it is hard to put down
i love just about everything about it the only thing i dont like are the glitches like being autocorrected when i have the stuff shut off are the keyboard suddenly disappearing
great interactive app that continues to add new pertinent features gold standard for free speech
x allows me to view a full spectrum of opinions and news sources which in turn allows me to draw my own conclusions be better informed
despite being infinitely better under elon there are still many cowardly bad actors that shadow ban your account for no reason whatsoever no emailnotification regarding why just randomly turning off your accounts ability to do anything for hours over and over again very cowardly behavior undoubtedly from the usual suspects not to mention elon allowing the adl to dox members with no repercussions your cowardly and useless reply will prove me right why would i pay for such an app
good source of news snippets but need to be careful and crosscheck anything you read
wouldve been a decent app if it didnt reset my algorithm every month now stuff recommended to me is just garbage the not interested button doesnt work pressed it in numerous posts but keep seeing similar stuff
been going downhill since changing hands names also apps tell you what is in each update this one doesnt
the name is confusing at times i would name it xt because theres my x account and then theres my xs account dont read it say it
very good app but wayyyyyyy too many bugs and random crashes it doesnt crash on my redmi though
in a recent update twitter has limited the functionality of the block button people who are blocked can still see profiles theyre blocked by this is insanely dangerous to millions to everyone at google play crack down on it
i dont know why recently i am facing a issue like when i scroll the music of last content keeps on playing even if i have skipped it and watching other content and sometimes even if app is closed but its in the tab it still plays the content sound neep help its annoying
currently no social media app one issue that persists is while scrolling through videos sometimes audio from last videos keep playing till i close the app
this app just got horrible in short words it gotten to be more of an adult app lots of nudity and alot of hateful racism time to go on to a better app
trends are awful now its all bots saying exactly the same thing theyre supposed to be the top posts too its just bots and engament farming
recently updated itself and since then im constantly getting playback error on video clips also way too many ads many of which you can not block i spend more time blockingtapping i dont like this ad than i do reading proper posts
i love that every time i respond to something with my opinion it doesnt get deleted and i dont get banned because it doesnt fit their narrative freedom of speech is becoming less and less free thank you elon for cleaning house and not silencing the american people
im not someone who uses many apps x is a rare one i do daily for people who are looking for an environment thats not agenda driven biased censorship x be it
this not buggy or shuts it works great and lots of info on here plus anyone can say whatever cant get muxh better thanks elon keep shooting for the moon
x has become the town forum since elon musk purchased it i really enjoy reading breaking news stories as well as mere passing thoughts from some of the most influential people of our time
why cant i login again i changed my phone and the next thing is i cant login or even create a new account its frustrating actually
having problems signing in because it will not accept my user name it says needs user name starting with symbol have reset my password to a new one and still cant get past user name starting with help please
censorship is bunk free speech is most important do i agree with everything no of course but thats the beauty of life btw i didnt vote for trump or harris
why does it take a long time to refresh each time sometimes it doesnt refresh at all and doesnt show new posts please fix this
i just love this app i have no issues with it and it is the best app to interact with people and be updated on current news
before elons takeover stars after elons takeover negative billion platform is now a haven for white supremacist hatred nonconsensual ai content scraping inundated with scammers and verified hatemongers actively calling for others to be killed for their identities and political affiliations if elon wants x to be americas version of wechat its nowhere close to being one and too many features require paid subscriptions rename this as truth social because thats what x is now
full of disinformation bots i would never trust x for accurate or trustworthy information its also very polarized and nothing x does fosters healthy discourse
i never really used or liked social media and reluctantly made an x account recently i have been mind blown this is not just social media this is the media
recently edited to say the block button literally does not function as it should anymore do not install
very stupid app developers when i like or follow nsfw content x always lock my account ask to pass arkose test it is so stupid that it is not blocking the nsfw content upload but when i like or follow it locks my account
cant shake the porn bots cant truly block people and now im getting porn adds even though nothing in my algorithm should warrant that reporting dangerous behavior is pointless
out of stars why cause when i downloaded this again and tried to login with my google account it kept saying unable to complete requestplease fix this
wow if i dont like an ad i can block it very good step but the habit of suspending the account is very bad
ever since whatshisname took over this app has been failing there seems to be a point every day where new tweets notifications and messages refuse to load and i have to wait until the next day before it works again wouldnt be surprised if that doesnt happen for paying members
mobile x constantly crashes and wont be open for days its ridiculous
its just continuing playing sound from video even if the app is stopped swiped out and device locked horrible
i like that the app keeps me posted on those i am following but also outside voices to expose me to a different perspective
greatest source of news there is musks purchase of twitter has given truth seekers a free speech platform from which we can receive decipher and share realtime information this platform arguably changed the course of the election for the better maga baby lets gooooo
i keep getting my account locked for absolutely no reason its happened to me times the app is very buggy and just sucks in general maybe mr billionaire elon musk shouldnt be the one owning it horrible app
secretly the best therapy app nothing makes my day happier than seeing elon musk unleash his autism and displaying his new toys from spacex and tesla happy to see his childish joy
you cant block people anymore and that is terrible for everyone also i have to see elon musks stupid face way more often when i open this app and thats just awful
trash app crashes wont update feed bots and misinformation run rampant sissy spacex ran it into the ground bluesky ftw
its become a platform for only elon to communicate im kot interested in only seeing his updates even if i do not follow him deleting app today
my account is suspended dont know why i cant apeal for it on the submit apeal page just getting log in and out annoying just goin to uninstall
i keep having issues loading media even when i force close the app and re open it i cant load videos and pictures a lot of the time the content moderation is terrible and the quality of content has gone down drastically too
the app is good for sober engagement and conversations are taken seriously i would prefer twitter than
have used you tube so restricted have used tiktik got banned and lets china read every protocol on my device which leaves x elon made free speech available on this platform
my account got suspended and when i submitted an appeal there was no email or response from the x team for the past few days all my official work is kept on hold just because of these x teams negligence
usability continues to degrade for months now app has to be force closed and reopened any time you want to use it now even that sometimes isnt enough and when it does work its almost as if it was designed to suddenly force refresh the feed at the most annoying possible times
there are lot of bot and negativity in the platform it feels too polarized and discussion is too polarized and easily disagreeable
the new block feature goes against googles terms and conditions since it is not actually blocking trash
love the new x glad that elon musk bought it i have complete free speech and am never censored or shadowbanned i had never had a twitter before until elon bought it and had owned ran it for awhile before i got an x account i never would have joined this platform had it not been for elon taking it over x has helped to stop the censoring of conservatives real true information people need to see x has helped to save america the world
the whole app sucks ever since elon got it every update has gotten progressively worse the porn bots and regular bots do not help either i want my old twitter back
constant right wing posts being shoved down my throat in for you page blocked tate and musk and kept auto unblocking them after some time etc moving to bluesky app
bots are worse feed is worse organizarion is horrible and dont even get me started on the right wing propaganda no matter how much i try and tailor my feed
love this app i am able to get news directly from the politicians and journalists instead of looking for snippets of information elsewhere
terrible app full of adverts spam and bots there are far better alternatives out there
keeps logging me out randomly have to log back in every single time because it doesnt remember me
after the recent update x has been crashing a lot really a terrible experience
never saw crashes easy to navigate easy to use android galaxy z fold
the feeds sometimes keep on loadingthings that usually take second now can take minutesreally frustrated
mostly good but i have trouble seeing videos and images while using wifi
i think that the app is good but i also think that when credit is due to someone when someone has the power to give the credit due to the person that is credited to i believe that they should do it not waste any time or leave them in a daze or not knowing the information awards that are not actually presented as awards or something in the someones left unknown on how to handle something that he doesnt even know he has then its not a reward and it makes suffering in chaos
only place to keep up with what really important in news and culture avoid media spin be thinking for yourself
love x but this app really needs a new ui option for devices with foldable screens
most useful social media platform right now as an american its not as free speech as id like but for a world wide platform its as close as your going to get
so take this one star great job removing the block button so everyone can be in danger i hope you are happy
i have bought x premium subscription from google play but it always asks me to open the app and confirm the subscription but when i open the app nothing happens
elon it is so incredible to come to an app with so much truth and be able to speak truth without horrible censorshipits so bad out on most other platforms thankyou
laggy refreshes very often and takes a long time to load could be my hardware limitations p pro
whats with the latest update the app is misbehaving i cant log into my account every time i try its either an error or no username found
it was great until they removed the ability to see friends likes this must be brought back i assure you x that this will make you lose many users please bring it back you dont gain anything from removing that feature
still in beta no voice option yet still works great and cites its work well
the app is barely functional now itll just stop loading media or refreshing tweets i mostly use the browser version instead no matter how much i clear cache force stop or reset its really just luck whether or not the app works i miss twitter
videos dont play since july of this year home wifi and telephone provider dont work i can watch on laptop but not on phone sad
fun way for me to stay on top of the news and popular topics across many different fields simultaneously
great since it became free speech it was a dark place when the censorship was in place love the community notes
yoh my fav has gone to the dogs network working fine but app wont load and when it finally loads all you see is temu ads and elons rants all over the tl that time hes blocked then to rub salt on the wound videos would autoplay random things for me why hleng
x is far and away the best social media app free speech matters x is where the news is we are the media now
its devolving phone app is a mess only stupid changes elon spreading misinformation tablet app is awful users leaving
works well loads a bit faster than the website overall a great app x for the win
absolute cesspool of the worst people imaginable no reasonable moderation against hate speech an owner who bought his way into the government and an algorithm that doesnt care about what you interact with because it has a narrative to push this app is hot garbage
x has been the center of information that connects far and close friend in space for easy access to communication i love x
elon has made the app basically unusable can no longer block people and also im constantly getting elon tweet notifications also so much hate speech
i honestly hope apple and google follow through with threats to remove this app from their stores due to blocking being removed elon is a complete and utter moron and every change he has directed on this app has been for the worse the bots spam and scams have never been as bad as since he took over its clear the only reason he purchased twitter was to gain power on the political right elon crashed and burned this app and deserves to lose a fortune because of it
i love it i dont have to worry bout my posts being marked as misinformation and my account being disabled because some purple headed goon being offended also there is less people baiting other people to get there accounts deleted witch is hella nice good crowd good good good thats good three times
its the most annoying app the refresh function is poorly working all the time
i cant even get into my account my gmail account is linked with my phone number and still i cant access worst support ever so much censorship
new update doesnt allow me to update my timeline it just stays at the last thing i tweeted please fix nexus
to any advertisers reading this if i see you paying for an unblockable ad on this site i solemnly vow to never purchase your products as long as i live
the most trusted source of real time real information in the world by far elon seems to be on a quest to snuff out misinformation and disinformation at the source the main stream media that along with all the other components including spaces grok subscriptions etc puts this as a must have app no matter what device you have this will definitely one day be your absolutely everything app once x payments goes live
it would be higher butits not letting me log in ive uninstalled and reinstalled the app as well
it was a cool place to get news and updates about media unfortunatly since ellon musk bought it twitter has died and is basicly decaying now how sad
the block button still allows people to interact with your account so they can continue to harrass you useless feature
elon took over the thing and its stupid but im really having an issue with the dm voice message feature not working each time i pull up to let the message send it drops back down and requires me to cancel it
full of nazi bots and theyre doing nothing about it plus the block button isnt a proper block in a new update
its nice to know there is a platform where free speech truly exists its a good place for factual journalism and learning the opinions of all kinds of people on different topics so far i enjoy it
this app does not have a functional block feature those you block can still see your content which is dangerous and insights stalking and for minors to see adult content
the account i signed up for was immediately banned i emailed support and got no help i need help i dont know why i am a human
easy to navigate and use the only completely free speech app out there only thanks to mr elon musk does every person have a voice
very easy to use app with fast up to date views and opinions would highly recommend as a social platform for anyone who doesnt want to have to worry about having their voices not heard
as of the date of posting this it keeps crashing saying there is an error
numerous fullscreen backtoback adverts that autoscroll back into focus as you try to swipe down
if i could give this app a rating i definitely would if its not failing to load or retrieve a post then its logging me out and asking me to reverify my account this is very bad
deactivated and removed its been going downhill too negative now too many other platforms available one less to worry with
app keeps logging me out on android now unable to login app crashes while trying to login
many new updates and still does this constantly in the middle of reading a tweet and it autoupdatesscrolls and its gone l design
its an okay app yet the main issues i have with this app is that theres always hate homosexual and any type of hate posts are allowed on there which makes it hard for me and my friends to chat on there i hope this app goes back to the it was back in where the monitoring was really good at handling problems like this
app quality went down with the x rebrand updates go against google plays policy as well every feature gets worse everyday
videos wont play they just say playback error it auto refreshes constantly but then also wont load for minutes at a time until you kill the app nothing works and its so full of bots and misinformation its hard to sift through it all top to bottom its a terrible app
elon musk ruined this app its filled with ai spam and slop useless content and pushes controversial and disturbing content to your feed need i remind you the block option now doesnt actually block
i dont got the money for premium so i just got ta deal with verifying my account constantly besides that pretty decent cant complain
for the past month or so this app has been slow takes alot of refreshes for it to show images and videos
still no support for android s systemwide auto darkbright mode pathetic why do i have to toggle it in the app separately if i turn my dark theme onoff in the phones quick settings drawer
the app has become a dangerous place you cant even block to prevent people that make you uncomfortable from seeing your posts and page
when it works its great however i have a daily occurrence of my feed notifications messages and everything else not being able to load its been like this since the takeover unsure if its related but its painful
youd think if you want your users to doom scroll youd make your app stable enough to not crash every minutes
since elon took over x has more freedom of speech increased engagement from all users new features like x premium stronger community feel with direct interaction vital in realworld scenarios x now stands out for its critical communication support in global crises x has turned into a place where you feel like your thoughts and ideas can really take off its like the social media version of a freeforall where creativity and conversation are the most important
they now let your stalkers stalk you the block button no longer does anything this is very dangerous and actually against the law
x is now a cesspool of farright fascist nazi content it takes days for my likes and shares to disappear from the posts ive bookmarked sometimes see it happen immediately after doing either and now there isnt an actual block feature musk is a fascistic piece of who is actively throttling leftwing content and anything that is critical of him personally only still on here for following the people i trust
love it its one of the few places you can actually see hear read what is really going on i hope pray it stays this way
i cant open my x account password problem but x is not fixing it i putting my right email almost spend years what happened to x
i absolutely love x im from canada and its the only platform that allows free speech without getting in trouble for speaking the truth unlike facebook
best place for breaking news in the form of video as long as you treat everything with skepticism until community notes catches up
i have not received emails from twitter for a long time to notify me of direct messages what has happened to this function
always crashes barely able to use now for more than mins without it crashing
a growing cesspool that people are running away from faster and faster since they cant get real advertisers anymore its also become a place where every other post is a sponsored one from an account deep in the cesspool
constantly being followed by bots while most decent users have wisely long since gone by now a shadow of its former self
the new update of x has removed the feature that we could see who has followed us back on the following list of our account now its not there so please bring it back cause it was so helpful
its so bad i want to leave a zero but it isnt possible so a one cause first they suspended me for no reason second they wont let me appeal they keep saying im giving the wrong user nameemail number and password even its correct i hate this dang app
auto logging me out due to error many times auto refresh becoming obnoxious
i love the actual factchecking if you repost an article and turns out to be false information everyone that shared the post gets a factual correction in their notifications
what good is an app you cant even create a profile on the part capchas do not match at all can you guys please fix this
still like the platform for short thoughts but do use other social media for other things which are also posted here general rules have changed platform but still a source of good
the one place to hear different views and try to work out whats really going on awesome app great communities
user experience has deteriorated in a short amount of time constantly seeing far right content even though i dont interact with it and the connection will randomly stop working on android and i have to reset the app and even then its only sometimes fixed
got really bad recently too many inappropriate ads too many irrelevant contents that i am not even following
sad to see how far one of my favorite apps has fallen i wish it would return to its former glory i get so much joy from the people on this app
works smoothly and is free its like facebook but without the fake ads and scam links
this is a very userfriendly application i love that i am free to write as i wish and follow highprofile people while also feeling like theyre sort of like me
x is fun i love that posts can be longer and its just entertaining to scroll and see what people are thinking
full of misinformation on this app bluesky is better if you dont like being lied to purposely wish i could rate it zero stars
im unable to create an account in it after countless tries i also reinstalled it but the problem remains unsolved
amazing app whenever i need to find the unbiased latest news x is the place app is very fast and friendly
an actual free speech platform the usage can be a little cumbersome but definitely a platform where dissent is not banned
its a really nice app took some time to adjust because it isnt my usual social media platformwhatsapp is but all in all great app
its very informative and fun at the same time nice folks to chat with easy to find what your looking for love it
i am beyond disappointed because everytime i wan na create an account its always incorrect please try again please fix this problem
this app refuses to reload at least once a day leaving you stuck and the app unusable twitter was better
x randomly logged out my account i cant remember my password it gave me a message error your account was logged out wth
how is it that i have better experience using the browser than when using the app in terms of the smoothness of it the app always seem to lag even when the app is updated
ive never had a single problem with this app even before elon musk bought twitter now x its the best app on thr marketplace it has anything and everything you need and its the most free speech app there is facebook and ig get roasted by this app anyway of the week
why cant there be a better popular app i wish i could give it a negative score its so awful but nothing else exists for my usage of twitter every update since the musk it gets worse and worse more ads more pay to use less features im waiting for them to just make it be a app with each post you make costing just to do
free speech is back baby love the news articles and the feeling of connection x gives the entire world and one day mars
buggy repetitive ads search function ignores your own followers this app used to be much better
block feature doesnt actually block abysmal amount of bots rampant politically dripfeeding from targeted ads
it was a great app until elon came along btw he changed the block feature in a way that directly violates your terms of service
the app is laggy especially when watching videos and the now paid features are ridiculous as most of them were previously free to use also you never end up seeing interesting posts because the app prioritizes post from people who pay the subscription which is mostly scammers and porn bots scrolling through the feed is pretty much like walking in a mine field
there is so much that can be done with thelis platform it seems they only scratch the surface
digital town hall everyone has a voice absolutely the fastest way to catch up on real news
i deactivated my account and reactivated it back within hours and still lost all my followers and following twitter support is of no use you people are useless and this app has been breaking ever since that dikshit took over
so many issues where do i start scrolling stutters video playback errors randomly timeline refreshes randomly so you lose what you were reading unblockable ads why would i consider paying for this app when its so unstable
the block button doesnt even fully block someone they can still see what youre saying
most people know what uber is all about and this app is there to enable it all i use it and will likely continue to use it despite a user interface that rates poorly for accessibility oh my how many notifications other features such as the inability to consistently charge from the same funding sources continue to dog the experience but the app developers may say thats some backend process unrelated to their confusing inphone gem
too many bots and porn accounts too many adverts and content pushed on me that i dont want to see
i got a new phone and your app keeps telling me to enter a security key or back up code neither are working i know my password and everything
keep getting kicked out then cant log back in because it says mt email is for a different account when it isnt im done waste of time stars
love it never thought about twitter im and just got x couldnt help myself free speech is under attack in this country and i want a platform that isnt biased towards any group of people
its an really good app miss not being able to see peoples likes tho ngl also think they need to make the flag as nsfw more easy to find
i want to know how can i enable the fleet in twitter kindly let me know i installed twitter yesterday in my mobile and the twitter is updated the fleet option is not showing waiting for response
this app is like a ray of sunshine finally i have a source of real unbiased news its amazing to see how much the main news channels hide from the public
whatever your needs x has your best interest at absolute truth and trusting exploration it only gets better with you
cant even open this app normally anymore i have to open and close several times and hope i get lucky and can actually use it this app is hanging by a thread since elon took over keeps glitching all the time someone get elon something else to destroy so he can leave twitter alone
at first when it was twitter it was frustrating to see the app basically silencing people that the original owners didnt like pandering to the liberal point of view now everyone has a right to speak their mind without being silenced cause someone didnt like the plain facts and truths presented rather than feelings still have an issue with botsfake accounts but which social media app doesnt
the change made to the block feature totally defeats the purpose of blocking people theres no need for people ive blocked to see my tweets or for me to see those of people who block me
every couple minutes the app decides not to work or load for the next hours this bug has been ongoing and getting worse been happening for well over a year now the bots the scams the crypto videos not properly loading was bad enough but now its just straight up unusable
aside from the awful algorithm promoting far right conspiracy and only blue tick accounts everywhere elon has now decided the block button doesnt mean anything and allows people to view your profile and tweets still surely a violation of privacy
used to be a great social media app but its now just filled with ads bots and is echo chamber for both sides of extremes in politics not worth the download
not optimal but the best compared to other social media lately its getting more and more restrictive due to the push from the semites
this is the only platform i use it has everything i need news entertainment politics supports free speech elon musk has made this app work well
i love this app its got the best memes best environment is a good source for news i love the fact checking process and most importantly it has free speech
look up whats actualy going on in the world regretful to not have time to use the app to full potential
its good i appreciate the free speech platform not perfect but so far its much better than many other alternatives
i enjoy using this app for the most part but x sometimes doesnt update my timeline on the app this can take up to an hour to fix its self and this is my main complaint and back when x was twitter the app worked better then it does now but i still recommend using the website because the website works better then the app and the old name still works for the twitter website and when the platform was still called twitter the had less issues i know we all call this twitter thanksgoodbye
besides the financial gains on x the trust is out of the roof verifiable news at its best i love this app
download this if you want to be harrased by stalkers and nzis because there is no sense of privacy or decency here just a waste of space training another pointless ai algorithm
i want out of this app but i cant recall my password i am unable to close and delete my account please help
theyre currently removing the ability to block users from seeing your content which is a violation of googles rules google please do not let them blatantly break your rules like this please reject their change or remove them from your store
at this point it is all just ads like a ad to tweet ratio now you cant block people like why
x is doing exceptional job the number one trusted app but they suspended my account still waiting to hear from x team after an appeal
this app barely works half the time even with completely restarting this app it still freezes often and ends up unresponsive twitter has gone downhill for the past few years and its app bad only gotten worse and worse
i dont know what going on my twitter app seeing so slow still not responding at the moment i dont know how or where seriously this app needs hurry up stop causing too much delays is not what am expected
ads loading absolutely makes the app laggy and also auto scroll when viewing videos is annoying
useless notifications of random posts from people i already dislike for being a notification to thousands of other people as well
its fairly easy for even a newcomer to navigate within this app and i like that information is not censored
its a bug ridden mess timeline abruptly ends just after opening the app
great app for keeping up with current events is also quick to load and easy to operate
easy to scroll sources good to navigate and also facts checks which is awesome only downside is the word amount of ads that constantly pop up
wow those terms of service are pretty invasive time to find a better alternative
the only place you get real news and the true story unfiltered truth freedom of speech would be dead without x
best apps ever where you get to see both sides of the story instead of getting censer where youll become a heard of sheep controlled by the elitesgovernment
my twitter account was locked and i wanted to make a new account it but the locked account had my email so i wanted yo delete it but i cant maybe i shouldnt have made a twitter account
its just turned into a right wing political app no matter how many times i hit not interested it just keeps popping up
free speech yo its cruel unhinged and a better news source than actual news organizations what more could you want
its good hopefully more futures to come just allow the user to download videos too not only pictures
the app is far worse under elon than it used to be for you page not loading tweets quote tweets not showing ads etc is
x twitter is not fun anymore app glitches videos not reproducing and algorithm is so political
i have encountered play back error still not fix i tried uninstall and install back but still i cant play the video
thank you elon for making free speech viable again even if its speech i disagree with its still free speech protected by the constitution
it sucks after the apps rebranding to x it become worse i cant even read the tweet its just sucks we miss twitter
everytime i try to respond in my dm this app shuts down its been going on for well over months now and its the worst really i literally fight for my life and struggle when using that app but because i love things i continue the fight something needs to change please
i cant repost tweets like it keeps saying failed to post and i dont know why it keeps on happening this never happened to me before what is this
first app ive used and not been censored thats the way every app should be free speech is a constitutional right of every american
great app lots of information and different opinions on any subject everybody important is there keeps open and free from censorship conversations between all people
i have downloaded twitter on my mobile but it doesnt work consistently sometimes it runs but most of the time it doesnt i want to know why twitter isnt working properly on my phone even though everything else like youtube facebook and whatsapp works perfectly fine is this issue only happening to me or is it a common problem
the only thing this app had going for it for years was the structure after some dutch apartheid baby took over it doesnt even have that so the only thing keeping this site afloat is no one wants to leave but ever decision made over the past month is making that a very real possibility for everyone edit can i make it less than one star because every week since the new ceo the site has gotten buggier and its design worse
as of you can no longer block people from your page they can still see your content but can not interact
the only platform you can express yourself but do it with respect keep the logo like it is love the new features
i absolutely love x its the true definition of freedom of speech thank you elon best app for non bias news
the app crashes daily anymore refuses to even load its not my equipment or connectionits the app update its even worse can not log access at all most evenings all other apps and connections work its this place
best site for news and the fastest updates to stories the addition of the community notes is also huge because its live fact checking that includes reliable sources not just partisan courses
its just too good this is where i turn to to confirm things its not just a social media app it is an app that has a lot in it be it news lifestyle technology etc i strongly recommend
there was no right to freedom on twitter and won social media apps are the worst and worthless create an account three times one day it works then one week it doesnt work whoever bought such a bad app curse you
absolutely best app in the entire world hands down truereliable coverage of todays top headlines and everything in between
had to delete reddit because of all the liberal adspost being shoved down my throat love x it only shows what im interested in
i am seeing a vast improvement with this app keep it up only one thing how to stop the spammers from sending me follow requests that have links for porn sites etc
many times app doesnt work feed doesnt get refresh very frustrating
app has become unusable after recent updates the app sometimes loads the content correctly then starts misbehaving it doesnt load content after several refreshes as well it doesnt work properly even after clearing cache
wish i could give no stars repeat suspensions for violence on posts that contained no violence at all st time for hours now for days i paid for a subscription to support the free speech platform but it turns out that its just a scam elon is just a conman tricking people into paying for a subscription and then suspending views that go against the approved narrative the appeal process is nonexistent it just says your account is not locked or suspended sign into one that is
i can not believe the show i just witnessed since all the cues were there this whole time and key players made big moves thank to gods times we are patriqts this has been amazing to watch the sheer genius of this thank you elon you are amazing
this app is ridiculous lately ive literally gotten ads in a row with no other content in between the ads are also the only thing that loads when i get to other posts i can see text but images and videos just never load in absolutely horribly mismanaged by x
playback error playback error playback error i can run the mobile website version fine but its frustrating that after a few minutes of having the app open all i get is playback errors on all videos
awesome job protecting our free speech this app is great for gathering information and staying in touch with world events
informative intuitive robust and most important to me not subject to government censorship
works smooth as butter these days with the community notes is much easier to navigate whats true
great social media posting pictures and videos problem there has been many people posting inappropriate photos nsfw like adult nudity gore and more without putting the nsfw warning so that underage or teenager wont see it i keep seeing many adult nudity even im in safe account that wont show post with nsfw warning thing
i like how you can tweet your videos from your phones camera but when you want to record a video and tweet it you only have about a minute to record a video so when you update twitter can you make it so that you can record longer videos please update i dont like the fact that you made everyones liked videosimages list as private can you undo it please
honestly this app is barely functional most of the time messages and any post that isnt just text takes ages to load if at all and its stuffed with features that you wont be able to use unless you pay for the app
got it because there was literally no other way to view my city water utility updates if youre not logged in x doesnt show by most recent making the x post feed useless upon logging in i was immediately assaulted by walls of borderline porn sleezy ai generated posts and of course elon musk posts followed by a prompt to pay for upgraded service which crashed the app looks like half the reviews here are written and voted on by bots too so be wary when reading them
they are doing this thing where they show you new posts when you open the app and then they refresh and they disappear i do not know how to turn it off there is no support there is an option to disable notifications but i keep getting them anyway
ever since elon muskrat took over the siteapp has steadily gotten worse and worse constantly breaking and glitching the censoring of very specific people who muskrat doesnt like and words her personally finds offensive but allows racism and bigotry really just a clown show that is only as popular as it is because there is nothing else to move to capitalism kills yet another social media platform
the rebranding of twitter to x brings a fresh modern look and improved functionality the expanded character limit and enhanced media sharing options allow for richer content customization features let users personalize their profiles more than ever engagement tools like polls and spaces have been refined for better interaction performance is smoother with quicker load times x is a significant upgrade making it a top choice for social media enthusiasts
i never used this app for almost the entirety of the twitter years as i diddnt like the format or the overwhelming numbers of far left virtue signalling cry babies since its rebranding the content has become much more balanced and i find the overall user experience to be much better i also believe it to be an extremely important app as it is standing up against government censorship and political interference
new rating since becoming x could use improvements definitely not the same app anymore still better than facebook for an infinite wealth of reasons but at the same time could use some similar features to make it feel more connected and meaningful and not such a playground of adhdpromoted delight still works the same as it did for crypto and business but now you can actually monetize your presence which is a nice option for those spending the time to do so
good app continually improving definitely need to sort out video playback though
didnt use twitter so cant compare the but havent had any issues with x
far right politics has been pumped incredibly hard on this free speech app you simply can not promote both free speech and an agenda it is a conflict of interest
elon has made it a bots heaven theyre just paying for a blue tick then make ads elon pays them for it basically if you havent paid for a blue tick youre basically muted anyone who has paid for a tick their replies automatically appear over a normal user so not only is it a bots heaven now its definitely a tier community at least with the old version before elmo ruined it we knew if someone had a tick next to their name they were the actual person or company you wanted
hey you know blocking people what if they dont block people or better yet have you pay a monthly subscription to type more and have access to a useless ai chatbot
i dont know whats going on with twitter but i feel like im in the th circle of hell because the app was working fine then all the sudden it changes to something i can not describe which i wish i could add photos to share it became a list of peoples tweets and i cant read them all it shows me is the persons profile pic and the date which is even weird instead of giving me the date like for example today is august it shows me dec like what im in the year of dec st
x application is an exceptional tool that has revolutionized the way i insert taskaction its intuitive interface and userfriendly design make it incredibly easy to navigate and use the features are robust and wellthoughtout allowing me to lve noticed a significant improvement in sindh since i started using x application its saved me so much time and effort and the results are impressive
when i tried to login it says my password is wrong as it is same as ive saved in google and then i want to do forgot password option but in first attempt it says too may attempts try again later but its the first attempt i uninstalled and reinstalled it but it remains same as earlier please help or else go to hell you bloody morons
love it also please make fleets come back also why do you keep auto refreshing stop that feature already
the problem now seems to be it wants me to put my birth date in locks me out until i do i understand why theyd want it for agerelated media security so when i inputted my birth date chose only for me ie not to be made public my birth date showed up in my profile for all to see i deleted it straightaway to my mind its a breach of trust its now asking for my birth date again i tapped help support to redress the issues raised above but that resource is now absent
skims all your content whether you disable it or not in settings for their ai model also implementing a change allowing blocked people to see your posts which is super ick
get the bugs fixed bring back twitter circle and drop the twitter blue s make the app great musk or stop trying at all youre honestly ruining the app all together my guy
x is an amazing common group for expression of thoughts and sharing of experience its features are relatable and its engaging trends are second to known x is the most used app amongst my app and i enjoy it as get latest update and trending topic in my next review i will state ways to improve the app but for nowwelldone to the developers tims network
best social media app by far most upfront and honest there will always be a few wild things said by people but id rather people say what they want than all of us live by some script god bless america
after the lastest update it constantly crashes i can not use the app at all the web version is also suck full of annoying advertisements and bluecheck bots with fake engagements worst experience i used this app for years but now its a downfall i hate this app i just miss the people there hope someone will takeover it and make it twitter again
the quoted replies function was working perfectly fine but its broken again fix it it would be appreciated if theres permanent solution to this particular problem
not only is functionality of the app only passable at best w multiple ways for it to crash due to video playback but just recently the decision was made to change how the block function works making it useless pointless to remove the optout for grok data collection forcing every single user to be made available for their inhouse genai both of which iirc are breaks in the play store tos social media in the hands of a capitalist grifter
the cesspool of social media what else can i say its twitter nothing more the app works well its one of my least used social media platforms so i dont really mind any minor bugs or glitches i dont spend that much time in it to notice them overall pretty good no censorship but that goes for the good and the bad
i dont like the timeline refresh automatically concept when i see a post and i read the comments after that i scrolling down i wan na see the old posts but its scrolling up automatically to new posts i really hate it i like the old blue version when i do it manual
please please please make all videos have the audio buttonicon turned on i dont want videos to be muted ever im sick of needing to tap the video as sound icon isnt visible until it opens in a separate page then audio begins then i have to close it again after viewing it wastes so much time distracting having to go to a different type of page layout i would love an option where you always hear it play audio when scrolling thru videos press play or pause for more than seconds
i went from using the site daily to maybe once a week to once a month in the last year i only use it to check up on people i care about but finally uninstalled today nothing on this site is worth the aggressive irrelevant ads that pop up even after blocking or expressing disinterest via i dont like this ad it will push random content in front of you including graphic or morbid images and videos that auto play plus upcoming regressions in privacy and safety i cant justify using x
ive had the worst experience with the x app lately every time i try to use dms the app crashes i cant even send messages without freezing media fails to load constantly making it impossible to view or share images and videos its also incrediblely laggy and choppy the performance is so poor that it feels like im using a decade old phone this is literally the worst app experience ive ever had please fix this issues this is unacceptable for a platform of this scale
the experience is bad and they continue to make terrible changesupdates the not interested button does not function it will show me the exact same tweet a few minutes after explicitly saying i dont want to see it and tweets like it the only good thing that came out of this is the community notes feature i love that feature i recommended anyone to use a competitor anything other than this dumpster fire
cant even log in the app when i try to it just goes back to the login page did a lot of retries and reinstalled as well still no luck bummer might as well uninstall unless they fix the issues their users are experiencing and please do listen to users of your app if you want them to have smoother experience with it
never mind negative reviews this is one of the best social media app in the world especially in the aspect of web whether it was changed from twitter to x doesnt matter it still stands out
cant even log into the app keeps saying something isnt right try again later as if were back in the s and need to call the customer service another time when theyre free unbelievable im not even in need of the app i use it fine on chrome when i need to but in order to access another app that had login through twitter i now must download the app its frustrating to say the least
the user interface experience is getting really bad it would take so long to load up media and other functionality after muting or blocking other accounts for some reason it wouldnt refresh for a long time after charging my phone even though the app has been opened those things make it hard to customize our own experiences through the app ps after update it got worse sometimes it only load partially in a new refresh and never load below that
since a week im not able to refresh my feed or comments tried every trick in the book clearing cache clearing all data uninstalling and reinstalling the app etc but nope after reinstalling the app now i cant even log in as the application refuses to catch any internet speed feels hopeless and redundant to even try now pathetic experience
twitter allows its members to share postings yet the receiver has to have an x twitter account to see what was sent to them
x is overrun by bots and misinformation spreads quickly false stories often reach millions before theyre corrected making the truth less impactful while the platform claims to support free speech it actually promotes a distorted flow of information where sensational content spreads faster than facts its a clear example of how poor moderation and unchecked algorithms can harm public conversation
x is light years better than twitter ever was i dont understand how supposedly so many very recent reviews just popped up to mention all these bugs and errors unless its a psyop i have the app on multiple devices including my phone tablets etc and it works flawlessly even simultaneously
the only app for free speech and i love that grok is improving and so much less censored especially for more brutal historical information
i have never used x before and now found out that the account i just opened is permanently blocked or shut down how can i get this fixed i dont even know how to use x
i love the fact checking feature called community notes these are small notes that provide additional context on tweets the notes also expertly prevent misinformation while still allowing free speech theyre an excellent addition even better youll find hilarious memes on this app too try it youll love it
app is terrible among many problems notifications dont stack anymore and just replace each other so i have to open app to check any more notifications flooded with low quality content from people who share terrible with the apps owner
getting worse as the weeks and months go by as i write this i havent been able to refresh my feed for hours and the app randomly decides to stop functioning completely whenever it feels like it absolute junk
twitter now automatically loads and reloads my feed instead of enabling me manually load in the tweets when i click on hovering tab you guys should fix this its frustrating for tweets to be automatically reloaded while youre still reading a tweet once fixed will upgrade the rating to a star edit problem fixed star given
